## Author Guidelines: Affiliated Event

Affiliated Events (including formerly separate “Pre-Symposium Events”) are a venue for SIGCSE sub-communities or groups to arrange a time and place to gather and present or discuss topics of interest. This sometimes happens within the context of a meal or reception during the conference. We encourage submissions for events focusing on existing and emerging subfields, areas and groups of diversity, and bringing together communities of practice. We especially encourage events that help to develop new faculty and leaders in computing education.

The SIGCSE TS 2022 organizers encourage submission of proposals, which must include a description of the event, its importance and relevance to the Symposium and SIGCSE community, the proposed organizing committee (if applicable),  and the proposed format for the event.  The SIGCSE TS 2022 organizers will assign an appropriate room. **Affiliated event organizers are expected to arrange for and cover the cost of the room, room setup/breakdown, food, and/or A/V. Organizers are also responsible for handling all affiliate event websites, submissions, decisions, notifications, and publications. Organizing information and cost information is available in the application.**

**Proposals for Affiliated Events to the Technical Symposium undergo review, the process for which is not anonymous.** Affiliated events are selected on a rolling basis.  Acceptance criteria is based on availability of space meeting the event requirements and relevance of the event to the SIGCSE community.

If an affiliated event is accepted, the affiliated event organizers invite members of the sub-community to participate in the event, possibly through a Call for Participation inviting members to submit papers, posters, or applications for participation. Event organizers are responsible for handling all organization of their events, including registration, affiliated event websites, the review process if the affiliated event solicits contributions, and participant organization. Affiliated event organizers will work with the SIGCSE TS 2022 Affiliated Events co-chairs for coordinating contact information (e.g. contacts for room setup/breakdown; catering; A/V) .  All attendees at the affiliated events must also be registered for SIGCSE TS 2022.  The SIGCSE TS will include the title, organization, abstract, and date/time for the affiliated event in the overall schedule on the Symposium website.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
The full proposal contains an abstract and a body that describes your event (as detailed below). The full proposal is used for the review process only. If the proposal is accepted, the abstract is the description that appears on the Symposium website and in the Symposium program and proceedings. The format for the proposal is as follows.

### Event Proposal Format and Contents
- **Title:** A title for the Affiliated Event.
- **Abstract:** A description of the event. 
- **Proposer(s):** Include name, affiliation, email address, and website address. You should expect most correspondence related to the conference to arrive via email. 
- **Event URL:** List the anticipated URL for your event website here.
- **Significance and Relevance of the Event Topic/Purpose:** Please include information about any trends in relation to the subfield and possibly describe (or cite) evidence to that effect. Your objective here is to explain why the event or community served is significant.
- **Intended Audience:** Briefly describe the nature and size of the intended/expected audience. This information will help gauge the level of interest the SIGCSE Technical Symposium attendees will have in the Event.
- **Expertise of Organizer(s):** Give a summary of the qualifications of the organizer(s) as it relates to the event being proposed.
- **Rough Agenda for the Event:** Timing details would be helpful here. Explain what the attendees can expect. Be sure to budget a realistic amount of time for questions from attendees.
- Proposers of hands-on events should indicate which of the following formats they wish for their event:
    - **Laptop Required.** Participants should bring a laptop computer to participate in this event.
    - **Laptop Recommended.** It is recommended, but not required, that participants bring a laptop computer to this event.
    - **Laptop Optional.** It is not necessary for participants to bring laptops to this event.
- **Audio/Visual and Room Setup Requirements:** Please enter these to help find the right room/space for your event. As stated above, you will be responsible for ensuring the room is set up for your needs. However, knowing your requirements may enable the Symposium organizers to schedule your event in space that will reduce your costs.
- **Event Time Preference:** You have the choice between 
    - Wednesday (day or evening) 
    - Breakfast (on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday as scheduled by the Affiliated Events Chairs);
