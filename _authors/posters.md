## Author Guidelines: Posters
 
Posters provide an opportunity for an informal presentation featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper.
 
Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.
 
Graduate or undergraduate students submitting posters may instead wish to submit to the [ACM Student Research Competition (SRC)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/authors/src) held at SIGCSE Technical Symposium. Like normal posters, ACM SRC posters are displayed at the conference, but the top poster authors also present their work orally, may win prizes and proceed to the international ACM Student Research Competition. 
 
Unfortunately there will not be an [award from the Council of Undergraduate Research (CUR) for undergraduates presenting posters](#cur) at SIGCSE TS 2022.

## Poster Topic Ideas
Any topic relevant to the conference focus areas is suitable for presentation as a poster. These include new results and insights around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, curricula, and courses.  However, the topic should lend itself to presentation in poster format with additional details available in a handout or web page. You might consider a poster presentation of teaching materials that you would like to share or preliminary research findings, such as:
- imaginative assignments
- innovative curriculum design
- laboratory materials
- effective ideas for recruiting and retaining students
- pilot study completed
- data collected, initial results
- computing education research that is in a preliminary stage
 
Suggestions for poster design are given in [Creating Effective Academic Posters](https://urc.ucdavis.edu/creating-effective-academic-posters) [UC Davis] and [Research Posters 101](http://xrds.acm.org/article.cfm?aid=332138) [ACM Crossroads article]. While both of these references provide suggestions for student researchers, the ideas are also applicable to posters for this conference.
 
## Poster Presentation
SIGCSE TS 2022 will be held in hybrid mode and we expect  presenters to present their poster in person or via videoconference during a dedicated time slot, as well as interact with attendees asynchronously via chat. 
In addition to submitting a pdf of your actual poster (what you would normally print out and display at an in-person conference), authors will also be asked to create a short video. More details about presentation formats and materials will be provided once the format of SIGCSE TS 2022 is finalized.
 
## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
 
NEW since SIGCSE TS 2021, **submissions must be anonymized for review**.  The goal of anonymization is to, as much as possible, allow the author(s) of the submission an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the submission such as websites or related publications). Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].
 
The full submission should include: 1)  abstract, 2) extended abstract, and 3)description of your poster (as detailed below). The same abstract needs to appear in two places: in the PDF of the full submission and in a text box on the submission web page.

The CCS Concepts, Keywords, and Copyright block / Bibstrip are required but the ACM Reference Format block is not, as shown in the template.
 
The full submission is used for the review process only. If the poster is accepted, the abstract will appear on the Symposium website. The abstract and extended abstract (i.e. the first page of your submission) will appear in the Symposium proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library. 
 
 
### Poster Submission Format and Contents
 
The document submitted for review is limited to {{site.data.submissions.posters.limits}}. Proposals are to be provided in PDF format.
 
Note that  **the first page of your submission will be published in the proceedings** (abstract and extended abstract), while the second page will be for review purposes only.  Therefore, the first page of your submission (that will go into the proceedings) must adhere to ACM’s publication guidelines:
{% include template-information.html %}
 
The first page of your submission should include:
 
-   **Title**: A title for the poster.
 
-   Anonymize your submission, **do not** include author names, affiliations etc. anywhere in the submission
 
-   **Abstract**: Limited to {{site.data.submissions.posters.abstract-limits}}. The abstract should summarize the major aspects and serve as an advertisement for your poster. Some aspects you may want to include are the objective(s) of the work being presented, preliminary results, future work, and intended audience.  The same abstract will also need to be submitted via a text box on the submission page. Please be sure that your abstract is accurate and that both submitted copies (in the PDF of the poster submission, and in the website submission text box) are exactly the same. The abstract will be posted on the Symposium website. 
 
-   **Extended Abstract**: The sections for this will vary from poster to poster, but it is expected to describe the main topic of the poster. A suggestion is to have the following sections: 1) Problem / Background / Related Work; 2) Overview / Methods / Results; 3) Contributions and Future Work. You may want to also list references. Your objective here is to explain why the topic is significant.
 
The authors of accepted submissions may edit the first page extended abstract in response to reviews prior to inclusion in the proceedings.
 
The second page of the submission, which will be for the reviewers only, and not included in the proceedings, should provide more context for reviewers. Examples of additional content you might provide on the second page include: description of tentative layout and content of the poster, description of any handouts that may be available, brief description of author expertise and background as it relates to the poster. You should also justify how your poster will engage participants in discussion. 
 
You do not need to submit the actual PDF of the poster itself for review.

## Council for Undergraduate Research Award
 
The Council for Undergraduate Research’s (CUR) Math and Computer Science Division is partnering with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium to reward excellence in undergraduate research as part of the Posters track. There are awards for undergraduate poster authors with significant contributions to the presented work. 
 
Poster presentations by undergraduates will be judged by at least two judges.  Students will be evaluated on the following:
 
* Organization: of the poster and the presentation
* Delivery: of the poster presentation
* Supporting Materials: explanations, examples, and/or illustrations that support discussion of the research
* Significance: the intellectual merit, research question importance, and foundation for future work
 
For consideration, please check the option **Presenting Author is an Undergraduate Student** during submission of the poster.  The undergraduate student must be present during the poster presentation to be evaluated and be eligible for the award.  
 
Please note that this award is separate from the [ACM Student Research Competition](/authors/src).  Undergraduate students participating in the ACM Student Research Competition are not eligible for consideration of the CUR award.
