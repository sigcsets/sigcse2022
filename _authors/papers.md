## SIGCSE Technical Symposium Paper Types

Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions. Initial submissions must be anonymous. Note that an **abstract submission is required for all papers** and it is due a week before the full paper is due.  

**Paper submissions are expected to be original and polished work.**  While there will be the opportunity to revise work from reviews, those revisions should be minor since there is no "review-revise-review" cycle for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  Additionally, we expect that submissions will include a review of previous, related work.

**Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct paper track. Papers will be reviewed for the track they are submitted to and will not be moved between tracks.**

* **CS Education Research** papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, and results as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; and studies of the many different populations that are engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.

* **Experience Reports and Tools** papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention and its context, and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didn’t, and why. This track accepts experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail so that others could adopt the new innovation.

* **Curricula Initiatives** papers should describe new curricula, programs, and degrees, the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. This track may also include position papers, which are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by presenting a defensible opinion about a CS education topic, substantiated with evidence.

### Selecting a Track
Please select the most appropriate track for your work.  The Program Chairs will not move papers between tracks. Any submissions made to more than one track will be desk rejected from both tracks.  

Authors may find ["What is a SIGCSE Symposium Paper?"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3243073) useful as they consider which track to submit to.  Research papers report on work that addresses one or more research questions where studies are pre-planned. Experience reports are a deeply reflective case study or experience that is of interest to the community; they typically don't have research questions, but instead, provide a reflection on the goal of the experience.  Tools papers that are describing a tool and its use should be submitted to the Experience Reports and Tools track.  A research study on a tool should be submitted to the CS Education Research track.

### Paper Resources
There are many resources for writing high quality papers for submission to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium.  We encourage authors to read and evaluate papers from prior SIGCSE Technical Symposium, especially those designated as *best papers*, which were selected both due to content and high quality reporting.  Authors will also likely find the [paper review guidelines](../reviewers/paper-review-guidelines.html) beneficial for identifying how reviewers will assess papers for each track.   We have linked in additional resources that you may find useful as you write your papers, especially computer science education research papers.

## Details about your abstract

Your abstract can be up to {{site.data.submissions.papers.abstract-limits}} and **must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline**.  There are no formatting requirements for the abstract. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field. The abstract submission is required if you want your paper to be submitted on **{{site.data.cfp.round[0].date}}**.

The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified and interested in reviewing.  To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that is as close to the finished version as possible.  The Program Chairs reserve the right to desk reject abstracts that do not contain content that can help a reviewer during bidding.

## How Should The Paper Be Formatted?

Authors must submit ONLY an anonymized version of the paper. The goal of the anonymized version is to, as much as possible, allow the author(s) of the paper an unbiased review. The anonymized version should have ALL mentions of the authors removed (including author’s names and affiliation plus identifying information within the body of the paper such as websites or related publications). Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know if the writer is citing themselves. That is, instead of writing “We reported on our first experiment in 2017 in a previous paper [1]”, the writer might write “In 2017, an initial experiment was done in this area as reported in [1].

If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, citations, and references.

The paper is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions.papers.limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

<div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<a href="{{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}">Formatting requirements, MS Word template, and LaTeX template</a>
</div>

SIGCSE {{site.year}} is NOT participating in the new ACM workflow, template, and production system.  *Word Authors*, please use the Interim Template. *LaTex Authors*, please use the official ACM Master with the `ACM_SigConf` template.

If your paper is accepted you will have a chance to modify your publication version before it is published.

## How Do I Submit My Paper?
Write your paper using the format specified above. Within the anonymized paper, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors, General Terms, and Keywords based on the ACM classification system. These requirements are described in more detail in the [ACM publication guidelines]({{site.data.publishing.acmpubguidelines}}).

SIGCSE {{site.year}} is NOT participating in the new workflow, template, and production system.  *Word Authors*, please use the Interim Template. *LaTex Authors*, please use the official ACM Master with the `ACM_SigConf` template.

Recall that you will also need to cut-and-paste or type your text abstract description into a text box during the submission process.

Be sure to choose the appropriate topic areas when submitting. Your choices help in assigning appropriate reviewers to your submission, and assist the reviewers in evaluating the paper from an appropriate perspective.
