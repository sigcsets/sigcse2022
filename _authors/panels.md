## Author Guidelines: Panel Session

Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panel members to present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss these views among themselves and with the audience. Usually, a panel session starts with a brief introduction of the panel topic and the participants, followed by short presentations by the panelists giving their views. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. The session must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question and answer period involving both the panelists and the audience.

A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the moderator. Limiting a panel to four participants allows sufficient time for audience questions. Proposals with more than four panelists must convincingly show that all panelists will be able to speak, and the audience able to respond, within the session time.

Criteria used in reviewing the proposals include the likely level of interest of the topic, the presence of panel members with multiple perspectives on the topic and significant expertise and experience, and the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for audience participation.

If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the panel description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.

## What if the Symposium is Virtual or Hybrid?

There is a real possibility that the SIGCSE 2021 Technical Symposium will be virtual or hybrid.  We believe that virtual or hybrid panels can still be lively and productive.  Panels should need relatively few changes from their in-person setting, but a strong plan for moderating questions from the audience productively in a virtual or hybrid setting will be necessary.  Please include in your proposal how you will ensure that the panel will succeed in a virtual setting and how you will ensure it will succeed in a hybrid setting.  Please do not refer to specific technologies.  Instead focus on the process that you will use to make sure remote panelists and participants are engaged and included.


## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}

The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:
{% include template-information.html %}

The following modifications and exceptions do apply:

-   When providing author information, indicate which of the panelists
    is the moderator by placing the word "Moderator" in parentheses
    after their name.

-   **Abstract:** Should provide a brief summary of your panel.

- 	**Summary:** The first section should be titled Summary and should provide an expanded summary of the panel’s goals,  intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community written by the moderator.

-	**Panel Structure:** The section following the summary should explain the panel structure and plan for audience participation and provide sufficient time for audience interaction and questions. **NEW for 2021** This section should explicitly describe how a virtual panel would be structured and run and how a hybrid panel would be structured and run.

-	**Position Statements:** The subsequent sections should contain the position statements of each panelist and a brief description of their expertise and background as it relates to the panel. Title each section by identifying the panelist.

-	**References:** Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If they are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.

If accepted, the panel description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}}  in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
