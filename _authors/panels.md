## Author Guidelines: Panel Session
 
Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panelists to present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss these views among themselves and with the audience. Usually, a panel session starts with a brief introduction of the panel topic and the participants, followed by short presentations by the panelists giving their views. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. The session must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question and answer period involving both the panelists and the audience.
 
A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the moderator. Limiting a panel to four participants allows sufficient time for audience questions. Proposals with more than four panelists must convincingly show that all panelists will be able to speak, and the audience able to respond, within the session time.

Criteria used in reviewing the proposals include the likely level of interest in the topic, the presence of panelists with multiple perspectives on the topic and significant expertise and experience, and the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for audience participation.
In recognizing the importance of diversity in all forms within the SIGCSE community, we encourage proposals whose panel makeup enables them to speak to diverse experiences and perspectives in relation to the topic. Note:  Please refer to [“ACM’s definitions of diversity and inclusion”](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/about). Please also refer to [“ACM’s recommended considerations when forming diverse teams”](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/diverse-teams)(or diverse panels in this case).
If the proposal is accepted, all panelists listed in the panel description will be required to register for the conference by no later than the camera-ready deadline and to participate in the session.
 
## Planning for an in-person or a hybrid session
We are planning for the 2022 SIGCSE TS to be held on-site in Providence but we also recognize that it may be necessary for some attendees and panelists to participate virtually.  Proposals should describe the authors’ preferred delivery mode for the panel (all panelists in-person, all panelists remote, or a mixture of in-person and remote panelists), and suggest how panelists will interact with one another and with the attendees.  
Note: Please keep in mind that the conference hosting technologies have not yet been finalized, and we may not be able to accommodate all suggestions for hybrid interaction.
  
 
 
## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}
 
The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:
{% include template-information.html %}
 
The following modifications and exceptions do apply:
 
-   When providing author information, indicate which of the panelists
    is the moderator by placing the word "Moderator" in parentheses
    after their name.
 
-   **Abstract:** Should provide a brief summary of your panel.
 
- 	**Summary:** The first section should be titled Summary and should provide an expanded summary of the panel’s goals,  intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community.  
-	**Panel Structure:** The section following the summary should explain the panel structure and plan for audience participation and provide sufficient time for audience interaction and questions.   This section should include a clear statement about the preferred delivery mode for the panel: all panelists in-person, all panelists remote, or a mixture of in-person and remote panelists.
-	**Position Statements:** The subsequent sections should contain the position statements of each panelist and a brief description of their expertise and background as it relates to the panel. Title each section by identifying the panelist.
-	**References:** Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If references are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the ACM formatting guidelines.
 
If accepted, the panel description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}}  in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
