## Overview
The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is a forum for educators and researchers to share new results and insights around developing, implementing, or evaluating computing programs, pedagogy, curricula, and courses. The conference is planned to be held in Providence, Rhode Island, USA and we are exploring support for hybrid participation. We particularly invite submissions that highlight computing education’s role in giving society hope for a better future, while aligning with the usual topics of interest, including broadening participation; strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion; K-12 and novice learners; improved and scalable pedagogies; leveraging data and analytics peer learning and instruction; novel outreach; events and engagement strategies; involving students in solving social and global challenges; advanced CS topics; and education research — including qualitative and quantitative, instruments, null and negative results. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium provides many ways to share ideas, including papers, panels, special sessions, workshops, the ACM Student Research Competition, Birds of a Feather (BoFs), demos, lightning talks, nifty assignments, posters, and affiliated events. We invite colleagues to contribute to, review for, and attend SIGCSE TS 2022. Once papers are accepted and finalized for publication, the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. At least one author of an accepted work must register and attend the conference.
**We invite colleagues to contribute to, review for, and attend SIGCSE TS 2022**.

### Reviewing
[Learn more about reviewing](/reviewers/) and [sign up to volunteer as a reviewer or APC](/reviewers/signup/). Reviewers play an important role in providing feedback to authors and in helping to identify the works that make up the confference.
-->


### Papers
[Papers](/authors/papers) describe an educational research project, classroom experience or pedagogical tool, novel position or curricular initiative. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of interventions (if any), including limitations. Initial submissions must be anonymous and must be in the appropriate track. **Note that an ABSTRACT SUBMISSION is required for all papers one week before the full paper is due.**
* **Computing Education Research.** Papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing research questions, methods, results, and limitations. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on educational goals and knowledge units/topics; methods or techniques; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; studies of the many populations engaged in computing education, including (but not limited to) students and instructors; and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.
* **Experience Reports and Tools.** Papers should carefully describe a computing education intervention, its context, and provide a rich reflection on what did or did not work, and why. This track accepts experience reports, teaching techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail for adoption by others.
* **Position and Curricula Initiatives.** Position papers should engender fruitful academic discussion through a defensible opinion about a computing education topic, substantiated with evidence. Curricula Initiative papers discuss new and revised curricula, programs, degrees and include position papers. Papers about curricula, programs, and degrees should describe the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, the impact, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it.

Papers may contain up to {{site.data.cfp.details["Papers"].limits}}. Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings. Authors of accepted papers will have a presentation of {{site.data.cfp.details["Papers"].length}} at the conference.

### Panels
[Panels](/authors/panels) present multiple perspectives on a specific topic. Panel proposals include a topic description, panelists, affiliations, panelist position statements, and a plan for audience participation. An abstract is included in the proceedings.

Panel proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Panels"].limits}} maximum and accepted panels will be included in the proceedings. Panels will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Panels"].length}} at the conference.

### Special Sessions
[Special Sessions](/authors/specialsessions) are your opportunity to design a unique {{site.data.cfp.details["Special Sessions"].length}} session in a standard conference space, but distinct from papers, panels, posters, or BoFs. An abstract is included in the proceedings.

Special session proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Special Sessions"].limits}} maximum and accepted special sessions will be included in the proceedings. Special sessions will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Special Sessions"].length}} minutes at the conference.

### Workshops
[Workshops](/authors/workshops) engage participants in learning new techniques and technologies designed to foster education, scholarship, and collaboration. Proposals must include an abstract, advertisement, intended audience and size, as well as equipement needed. Workshops do not have schedule conflicts with the technical sessions. 

Workshop proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Workshops"].limits}} maximum. Accepted workshops will have their abstracts included in the proceedings. Workshops will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Workshops"].length}} hours.


### ACM Student Research Competition
Undergraduate and graduate student ACM members are invited to submit individual research contributions from all areas of computing to the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC). An abstract is included in the proceedings.

SRC proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Workshops"].limits}} maximum. Accepted SRC abstracts will be included in the proceedings. SRC posters are presented during a poster session. Authors of selected posters will be invited to give a 10-minute presentation during an SRC session.

### Birds of a Feather
Birds of a Feather (BoFs) provide an environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for informal discussions. A/V equipment will not be provided for BoFs.

BoF proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Birds of a Feather"].limits}} page maximum. Accepted BoF abstracts will be included in the proceedings. BoFs will be provided a session of {{site.data.cfp.details["Birds of a Feather"].length}}.

### Demos
Demos showcase the relevance, potential, and innovation of a tool and allow time for discussion with its creator in the exhibition hall. Proposals include an abstract as well as power, A/V, and space needs. An abstract is included in the proceedings.

Demos proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Demos"].limits}} maximum. Accepted demo abstracts will be included in the proceedings. Demos will be provided {{site.data.cfp.details["Demos"].length}} during a session.

### Lightning Talks
Lightning Talks describe works in progress, new and untested ideas, or opportunities for collaborative work. Lightning talks are an excellent way to spark discussions and get feedback on an idea.

Lightning Talks proposals are {{site.data.cfp.details["Lightning Talks"].limits}}. Accepted lightning talk abstracts will be included in the proceedings. Lightning Talks will be provided a presentation of {{site.data.cfp.details["Lightning Talks"].length}}.

### Nifty Assignments
Nifty Assignments promote and share successful assignment ideas with enough materials available for others to adopt and adapt for their use. Proposals must include a short writeup describing the assignment, target population, strength and weaknesses, and what computing concept it teaches.

<!--
See the detailed [Nifty Assignments](/authors/nifty) author guidelines for the required material that needs to be submitted as a Zip archive.
-->

Accepted Nifty abstracts will be included in the proceedings as part of the Nifty paper.
