## ACM Student Research Competition
 
The ***ACM Student Research Competition*** held at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium will consist of graduate and undergraduate categories of competition, each with prizes awarded based on judging during the conference. **A submission to the Student Research Competition should describe recently completed or ongoing student research in any area of Computer Science.**
* All **graduate submissions** must represent a student’s individual research contribution --- neither supervisors nor other students are allowed as coauthors.
* **Undergraduate submissions** may represent individual or team research contributions. Research completed while the student was an undergraduate may be submitted to the undergraduate category even if the student is now a first-year graduate student.
 
A student must be an ACM student member to qualify for awards and travel grants (up to $500 may be available for students who do not have another source of funding).
Note: The authors of accepted submissions will have the option of participating in the Student Research Competition either in-person by physically attending the conference in Providence, RI, USA, or virtually. More details about attending the conference virtually will be provided prior to the conference.

## Preparing your ACM Student Research Competition Submission
 
Students will submit extended abstracts of {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].limits}} maximum, which will be reviewed to determine acceptance into the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) at SIGCSE. Reviews are not anonymous. If accepted into the ACM SRC, an abstract of {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].abstract-limits}} will be published (see below). 
 
Qualifying research may come from any area of Computer Science. The author submitting the abstract must still be a student at the time the abstract is due. Each submission should include the leading author’s name, affiliation, and email address; research advisor’s name; ACM student member number; category (undergraduate or graduate); research title; and an extended abstract (maximum {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].limits}} - references may be on the third page) containing the following sections:
 
* **Abstract**: max {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].abstract-limits}}
 
* **Problem and Motivation**: This section should clearly state the problem being addressed and explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.
 
* **Background and Related Work**: This section should describe the specialized (but pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the work. Include references to the literature where appropriate, and briefly explain where your work departs from that done by others. Reference lists do not count towards the limit on the length of the abstract.
 
* **Approach and Uniqueness**: This section should describe your approach in attacking the problem and should clearly state how your approach is novel.
 
* **Results and Contributions**: This section should clearly show how the results of your work contribute to computer science and should explain the significance of those results.
 
The extended abstract submission is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].limits}} plus a page for references and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:

If your submission is accepted into the ACM SRC, you will have a chance to modify your abstract of {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].abstract-limits}} before it is published.
 
A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using EasyChair, the online submission system.
 
## Submission Conditions for ACM Student Research Competition
 
No more than three research projects will be accepted from a single department and no more than two of those can be in a single category (graduate and undergraduate). Departments are determined by the location of the research advisor. Submissions for the research competition should describe the results of recently completed or ongoing computer science research conducted primarily by students.
 
## Upon Acceptance of your ACM Student Research Competition Submission
 
Authors of all accepted submissions will receive instructions on how to submit the publication-ready copy of an abstract of {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].abstract-limits}} that serves as a succinct description of the project. Deadline and instructions regarding publication-ready submissions are emailed to accepted authors. 
 
Authors of all accepted submissions are expected to present their posters either in-person or virtually during the Symposium. In case the authors attend the Symposium in person, a travel grant covering expenses for travel to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, including conference registration, transportation, lodging, and meals, up to a limit of US $500 may be provided to each student whose submission is accepted to the Student Research Competition. Students must be members of ACM to qualify for these awards.
 
## During the Conference
 
Judges will include professional computing educators attending the Symposium. Students’ research will be evaluated on the quality and significance of the work, and the quality and clarity of both an oral and visual presentation.
 
At the SIGCSE Technical Symposium, the first round of the competition evaluates the research during a poster presentation. Those students who are selected by the judges to advance to the second round continue in the competition by giving a short formal presentation of their research (10-minute presentation with 5 minutes for Q&A). The first, second, and third place winners as determined by the judges’ evaluation of the conference presentations in each of the undergraduate and graduate categories receive the prizes of $500, $300, and $200, respectively. 
 
Additional competition details, including information about past winners, can be found on the [ACM Student Research Competition website](https://src.acm.org/).
 
<!--  TODO: more information once more is known about how the conference will be done???
 
### Round 1: Poster Presentation
 
Your poster will be displayed for a 4-hour time period during the conference if you are attending the conference in-person. You will be expected to “present” your poster at that time and be available during judging. The space available for your poster will be 4 feet high by 8 feet wide, possibly with a small shelf below. Power sources are not available. Arrangements will be made for authors who will present their posters virtually. These details will be emailed to authors and posted here once the program is finalized. 
 
### Round 2: Presentation
 
Students selected to participate in the Round 2 portion of the ACM SRC will have 15 minutes to present their work during one of the sessions either in-person or virtually. Additional details about expectations will be provided prior to the conference.

## After the Conference
 
Accepted Student Research Competition abstracts (max {{site.data.submissions["acm student research competition"].abstract-limits}}) will be distributed in the SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education proceedings. They will be placed in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.
 
The first-place winners from each category (graduate and undergraduate) will advance to the ACM Grand Finals of the Student Research Competition where the winners of several ACM conferences compete for more prizes and recognition.
