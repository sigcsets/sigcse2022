## Author Guidelines: Special Session

Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium format. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, poster sessions, etc.) that are part of the SIGCSE  Technical Symposium. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, the form is yours to design.

For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, or a hands-on demo of dance moves proven to improve retention of computing topics.

Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.

Criteria used in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic. If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.

## What if the Symposium is Virtual or Hybrid?
There is a real possibility that the SIGCSE 2021 Technical Symposium will be virtual or hybrid.  We believe that virtual or hybrid special sessions can still be lively and productive.  Some sessions (e.g. committee reports with Q&A) might need relatively little modifications, while others (e.g. brainstorming sessions with attendees in small groups) might require a fundamentally different structure.   Please include in your proposal how you will structure your session if the Symposium is virtual and how you will structure your session if the Symposium is hybrid.   Please do not refer to specific technologies.  Instead focus on the process that you will use to make sure remote participants are engaged and included.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}

The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines.
{% include template-information.html %}

The following modifications and exceptions apply:

* **Abstract**: Should provide a brief summary describing your special session including session objective, intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community.

* Subsequent sections should contain the following information:

	* **Overall objective of the session**: Describe the topic of the special session and explain how the session will be organized (e.g., as a committee report, tutorial, hands-on exercise, …). Indicate why the proposed session is important and relevant to the SIGCSE community.

	* **Outline of the session**: Organize this section by subtopics, activities, or a similar scheme. If more than one participant is involved, label each section of the outline with the name of the participant who will be presenting that section. Note that in the case of a committee report, the presenters might be a subset of the authors. We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50% of the time for questions and answers or other interaction with the attendees.

	* ***NEW for 2021!* Plan for holding the session virtually and in hybrid format**: If the SIGCSE TS 2021 is held virtually, how will you ensure that the session is still productive?  If one or more of your leaders will be remote, how will you run a blended in-person/virtual session?  If participants are remote, how will they engage?  Your proposal should explicitly address how your session would be structured if it is run virtually and if it is run in hybrid format.  

	* **Expectations**: State the intended audience. Indicate how much the session will cover and what the audience should learn. If feedback from the audience is desired, indicate how it will be elicited. Explicitly stating these expectations is particularly important if your proposed special session is a tutorial.

	* **Suitability for a special session**:  Include a brief description that justifies the inclusion of this presentation as a special session. Explain why the proposed presentation is better suited for a special session than a paper or panel.

	* **References**: Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If they are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.


If accepted, the special session description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
