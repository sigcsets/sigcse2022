## Author Guidelines: Special Session
 
Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium format. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, poster sessions, etc.) that are part of the SIGCSE  Technical Symposium. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, the form is yours to design.
 
For example, a special session might be a seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, or a hands-on demo of dance moves proven to improve retention of computing topics.
 
Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.

Criteria used in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic. If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.
 
## Planning for an in-person or a hybrid session
 
We are planning for the 2022 SIGCSE TS to be held on-site in Providence but we also recognize that it may be necessary for some attendees and presenters to participate virtually.  Proposals should describe the authors’ preferred delivery mode for the special session (all presenters in-person, all presenters remote, or a mixture of in-person and remote presenters).  All proposals should also suggest how both in-person and virtual attendees can participate in the session.  Note: Please keep in mind that the conference hosting technologies have not yet been finalized, and we may not be able to accommodate all suggestions for hybrid interaction.
 
 
 
## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}
 
The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines.
{% include template-information.html %}
 
The following modifications and exceptions apply:
 
* **Abstract**: Should provide a brief summary describing your special session including session objective, intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community.
 
* Subsequent sections should contain the following information:
 
	* **Overall objective of the session**: Describe the topic of the special session and explain how the session will be organized (e.g., as a committee report, hands-on exercise, …). Indicate why the proposed session is important and relevant to the SIGCSE community.  
 
	* **Outline of the session**: Organize this section by subtopics, activities, or a similar scheme. If more than one participant is involved, label each section of the outline with the name of the participant(s) who will be presenting that section. Note that in the case of a committee report, the presenters might be a subset of the authors. We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50% of the time for questions and answers or other interaction with the attendees.
 
	* **Plan for virtual presenters and attendees**: Explicitly address how you will ensure that the session is productive for virtual attendees (in addition to in-person attendees).  If any of the presenters are expecting to participate remotely then this section should also suggest how these remote presenters would interact effectively with both in-person and remote attendees.
 
	* **Expectations**: State the intended audience. Indicate how much the session will cover and what the audience should learn. If feedback from the audience is desired, indicate how it will be elicited. 
	* **Suitability for a special session**:  Include a brief description that justifies the inclusion of this presentation as a special session. Explain why the proposed presentation is better suited for a special session than a paper or panel or other standard track format.
 
	* **References**: Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If references are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.
 
 
If accepted, the special session description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.
