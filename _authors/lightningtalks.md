## Author Guidelines: Lightning Talks
 
Lightning talks are expected to explore tentative or preliminary work, or even ideas for possible work. Lightning Talks describe works in progress (tentative or preliminary work), new and untested ideas (ideas for possible work), or opportunities for collaborative work. Presentations of mature work will not be considered. The purpose of a Lightning Talk can be to start a discussion, find collaborators, or receive input and critique about an idea. Proposals are limited to 500 words, including the abstract of 250 words, and will be **reviewed with a dual-anonymous process** for acceptance. Lightning Talk presentations will be a maximum of 5 minutes each. Presenters may use slides, but these must be submitted to the Lightning Talks Track Co-Chairs a few days before the presentation.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}
 
Lightning Talk proposals must be submitted in PDF format. The full proposal contains a title, an abstract and a description of the Lightning Talk (as detailed below). The full proposal is used for the review process only and must be anonymized. If the proposal is accepted, the title and authors appear in the printed program while the title, authors, and abstract appear in both the online program and proceedings. The format for the proposal is described in the following section.
 
## Lightning Talk Proposal Format and Contents
 
The proposal is limited to {{site.data.submissions["lightning talks"].limits}}, and should include the following:
 
-   **Title**: A title for the Lightning Talk.
 
-   **Abstract**: A summary of the Lightning Talk. The same abstract will also need to be submitted via a text box on the submission page. Please be sure that your summary is accurate and that both submitted copies (here in the Lightning Talk Proposal, and in the submission text box) are identical. Please recall that the abstract is the only part of the proposal to appear in the online program and proceedings and should thus be self-contained. Note that the abstracts of accepted Lightning Talks can be edited in response to reviews.
 
-   **Description**: Describe your talk in more detail. It will be helpful for reviewers to know why you are excited about the topic, and why you think others will be interested, too.  Outline how you plan to present your topic in 5 minutes. 
 
### Supplementary Materials
 
The abstract for an **accepted** proposal when published may contain a link to a website with more information. However, you should not include such links to any supplementary materials in your **initial** submission, so as to respect the dual-anonymous review process.

 
### Virtual Options
For virtual presentations, the presenter may provide a pre-recorded video of their presentation.  In any case the presenter must be available to participate live in Q&A during the session either in person or online via conferencing software.
