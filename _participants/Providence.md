# SIGCSE TS 2022 - What to know


## Before You Leave Home

SIGCSE TS 2022 has partnered with [Immunaband](https://www.immunaband.com) to verify attendee vaccination status for the SIGCSE 2022 Technical Symposium. You will receive an email from Immunaband to create a profile and upload your vaccine card. SIGCSE TS will accept WHO-approved vaccines, plus vaccines authorized or approved by the national health authority of the country where it was administered.  You will receive an two emails:
1. Immunaband email confirming your vaccination authorization.
2. An week or so before the conference, Immumaband will email you a receipt to bring to the conference.  **This is your proof of vaccination.** 

**You must be verified and cleared before picking up your badge at SIGCSE TS attendee registration. Be sure to submit you vaccine card no later than Monday, February 28.**

Please don't forget to pack your facemask! 

### What to Pack for the new era of in-person conferences
1. Your vaccination card, only as a backup measure in case of system failure.
2. Your Immunaband email stating this is your vaccination verification receipt for the conference
3. Masks

## Picking up your Registration Materials

Registration will be a tad different this year since all in-person attendees are required to be vaccinated.  Verifying vaccination will be the first thing you need to do to kick off the conference!  Stop at the Vaccine Verification desk, hand in the email proving you are vaccinated and receive a "I'm vaxed" bracelet. 

After you have received your ‘Vaxed’ bracelet, head over to registration to pick up your registration materials or register for the conference! 

### I forgot my email
We have set up this process to expidite checking into the conference.  The vaccine verification table will have a list of all attendees with confirmed vaccinations and can look up your name.  This will slow things down a bit, but you will not be turned away! 

### I forgot to register
We will have onsite registration available.  Once you have confirmed your vaccination status, the Registration Desk can help you get registered.

### I forgot to verify I was vaccinated
If you brought your vaccination card and can access your email, then things will be fine.  Create an account with Immunaband, upload pictures of your card and await receipt of verification.   Please be patient.  This will not be immediate, so you may want to check into your room, grab a snack or check email.  Once you receive confirmation, then go to the Vaccine Verification desk, and things will be fine. 

## Daily

Please monitor and [report your health daily](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Eu-ttWn0kzKiT9Ul7WQ6U4t1heYfDO8HW5RborNmjF8/edit)!  *If you feel well,*  then join the crowds and don’t forget to get your Safety Checked sticker in the registration area. *If you do not feel well,* we hope you will feel well enough to participate in the conference using Pathable. 

Please wear your mask and badge at all times during the conference

## Keynote/Ballroom 
Our keynotes will be delivered in a hybrid format. If you would like to ask a question or make a comment, then you will do that through the Pathable app instead of going up to the microphone.   This will be different, however, it provides all participants the chance to ask questions and minimizes our technology requirements.

All rooms at the conference will have normal and social-distance seating.  Please sit where you feel comfortable and enjoy the presentations!  

## Panels and Special Sessions in RICC 552 A/B, 555 A/B and 556 A/B  - Hybrid Rooms

Panels and Special Sessions will all be held in one of the three rooms supporting a hybrid format at the Rhode Island Convention Center.  These rooms are RICC 552, 555, and 556.  This is a new experience for SIGCSE, where presenters and attendees will be virtual and in-person!  There will be a camera focused on the front of the room, and no technician, so please follow the directions for interacting to ensure everyone can participate.

## Paper Presentations

Paper presentations will be held in conference rooms solely virtually or in-person. There will be no hybrid capabilities.  Social distance seating will be available for in-person events and we envision in-person sessions being managed as they have been in previous SIGCSE TS’s.
