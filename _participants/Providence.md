# SIGCSE TS 2022 - What to know


## Before You Leave Home
Immunoband is providing vaccine verification.  In order to support our global participants, humans review/approve vaccine documentation.  Therefore, please create your account and upload your vaccine card before you leave.  You will receive an email from Immunoband after you register with instructions on how to work with their system.

Please don't forget to pack your facemask! 

## Picking up your Registration Materials

Registration will be a tad different this year since all in- person attendees are required to be vaccinated.  Verifying vaccination will be the first thing you need to do to kick off the conference!  You will have created your account with Immunoband, and will now check-in at the Vaccine Verification table.  At this table, you will check your vaccination app with security and receive your bracelet. 

After you have received your ‘Vaxed’ bracelet, you are ready to pick up your registration materials or register at the registration booth. 

## Daily

Please monitor and report your health daily!  *If you feel well,*  then join the crowds and don’t forget to get your Safety Checked sticker in the registration area. *If you do not feel well,* we hope you will feel well enough to participate in the conference using Pathable. 

Please wear your mask and badge at all times during the conference

## Keynote/Ballroom 
Our keynotes will be delivered in a hybrid format. If you would like to ask a question or make a comment, then you will do that through the Pathable app instead of going up to the microphone.   This will be different, however, it provides all participants the chance to ask questions and minimizes our technology requirements.

All rooms at the conference will have normal and social-distance seating.  Please sit where you feel comfortable and enjoy the presentations!  

## Panels and Special Sessions in RICC 552 A/B, 555 A/B and 556 A/B  - Hybrid Rooms

Panels and Special Sessions will all be held in one of the three rooms supporting a hybrid format at the Rhode Island Convention Center.  These rooms are RICC 552, 555, and 556.  This is a new experience for SIGCSE, where presenters and attendees will be virtual and in-person!  There will be a camera focused on the front of the room, and no technician, so please follow the directions for interacting to ensure everyone can participate.

## Paper Presentations

Paper presentations will be held in conference rooms solely virtually or in-person. There will be no hybrid capabilities.  Social distance seating will be available for in-person events and we envision in-person sessions being managed as they have been in previous SIGCSE TS’s.
