Student volunteers are an important part of the SIGCSE Symposium and have been for many years. Student volunteers are on-site attendees attending the physical conference who are full-time undergraduate or graduate students. Each volunteer works for 9 hours (or less, as assigned), helping with various conference management activities. You'll interact with the conference organizers and presenters and will meet other students from all over the world. More information about the experience, the benefits, and how to sign up are provided below.

How do I register to volunteer?
-------------------------------

Registering for SIGCSE as a student volunteer is a two step process.

-   **STEP 1**: Register as a volunteer with the student volunteers team. As part of this registration, you will provide your availability for volunteer shifts. Please look at the schedule and ensure 1) that you do NOT select a shift where you have a conference commitment like presenting a paper or the ACM Student Research Competition and 2) that you do NOT select shifts where you want to see a particular talk. You can update your availability for shifts until February 9.  

After completing STEP 1, you will receive a discount code that you can use to register for the SIGCSE symposium in STEP 2. The discount code can be found on your profile page on the student volunteer website. The discount code makes the base conference registration fee free, but you are still responsible for paying all the add-on costs.

It is important that you complete your volunteer profile and provide availability on the student volunteer website. Otherwise, your discount code for the conference registration will be cancelled.


-   **STEP 2**: SEPARATELY register for the SIGCSE symposium as a student.
When you get to check out, you can use the discount code from STEP 1 to zero out the base conference registration fee. Note you will need to pay the costs of any additions to registration (e.g., workshop).

Please note that while in previous years we have been able to accept everyone who registered in January and often anyone interested, we cannot guarantee that this is the case every year. Please try to register as early as possible (you can provide your availability for shifts closer to the conference start as we understand that it can take a little while to arrange travel).

Also, please note that if you are no longer able to attend, we greatly appreciate you going back to the student volunteer registration system to cancel and emailing [volunteers@sigcse2022.org](mailto:volunteers@sigcse2022.org).

What To Do Once at SIGCSE Technical Symposium
---------------------------------------------

Upon arrival at the conference site, you must check in at the main SIGCSE Conference Registration Desk to receive your conference registration packet. Then visit the Student Volunteer Office to check in and to receive any needed instructions or updates.

Not completing all your assigned shifts will result in the revocation of your conference registration and notification of your on-site faculty advisor. You would then need to pay the registration fee to continue attending the conference at the on-site registration rate.


Institutional Coordinators
--------------------------

*SIGCSE Technical Symposium Student Volunteer Policy for schools that send five or more undergraduate student volunteers to SIGCSE*

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium relies on its student volunteer corps for the success of the conference. Hence, we are particularly grateful to the schools that bring larger cohorts of student volunteers. To ensure the best experience for student volunteers, institution faculty, and the Student Volunteer Coordinators, schools that provide five or more undergraduate students volunteers must designate a single Institutional Coordinator for all the student volunteers from that institution who must fulfill the following responsibilities.

-   The Institutional Coordinator must attend the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and be available via cell phone and email during the conference.
-   When possible, the Institutional Coordinator should accompany the volunteers to the Student Volunteer Headquarters when the students check in.
-   The Institutional Coordinator must attest to the ability of each of their students to accomplish the tasks expected of student volunteers. If appropriate, the contact may also meet with one of the Student Volunteer Coordinators for a confidential discussion of roles that might prove difficult for a student so that we can identify more appropriate roles.

If an institution does not designate a coordinator, we may limit the number of volunteers from that institution. In addition, schools that do not designate an Institutional Coordinator or whose students do not perform their tasks reliably risk losing Student Volunteer privileges in future years.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Who is eligible to be a student volunteer?

Any full-time student may become a student volunteer. (You must be a currently registered student at your institution!) Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. You must specify your school affiliation and a faculty member who will be on-site during the conference when you sign up as a volunteer. Students attending the conference for the ACM Student Research Competition are encouraged to become volunteers as well. Email [volunteers@sigcse2022.org](mailto:volunteers@sigcse2022.org) if you have further questions.

### What if I require a visa?

See the main [SIGCSE Attendees](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/participants/#visas) page for information about Visas.

### What are the benefits of student volunteering?

In exchange for 9 hours (or less, as assigned) of volunteer service, you will receive:

-   Complimentary conference registration.

-   Student registration for the registration includes student membership in [SIGCSE](https://sigcse.org/membership/benefits.html). 

-   A chance to meet and work with students from other schools.

-   Entrance to the student volunteer party.

-   Professional development workshops facilitated by faculty members specifically for student volunteers.

-   The opportunity to contribute to an effort to improve computing education... and our sincere gratitude for your efforts!

Note that in addition to these benefits, since you are a registered SIGCSE student attendee, you have all the rights of the non-volunteer student attendees:

-   Access to all sessions, including papers, panels, seminars, and birds-of-a-feather discussions.

-   Access to all exhibits where book publishers and software vendors have displays and activities.

-   All conference "coffee" breaks (some food and drink).

-   The main conference reception on Thursday evening (typically includes a light dinner).

-   The conference luncheon on Saturday afternoon.

### What kinds of work will I do as a student volunteer?

It varies. Duties may include (and are not limited to) the following:

-   You may work at the registration booth organizing attendee packets.

-   You may monitor the exhibit hall or reception entrance to ensure those entering have the appropriate conference badge.

-   You may count the attendees at various conference sessions.

-   You may assist speakers at various session types with handouts or equipment.

### Do I have a say in what work I do as a student volunteer?

We will try to accommodate your preferences as best we can; however, it is not always possible to meet every volunteers' preferences. If you have a skill we are interested in, then you get a chance to indicate that when you are indicating available work times (e.g. like working with children might make you a great choice to help with Kids Camp!). We also try to accommodate students who have a preference for a particular shift or session, but due to the complexity of scheduling and ensuring we have adequate coverage at all sessions, we cannot guarantee anything.

### When during the conference will I do my student volunteer work?

This will depend on conference needs; some time periods are busier than others. Your duties may be broken into separate time periods and even across separate days. We guarantee no more than 9 hours of assigned work per volunteer.

Please note that we'll take your preferences into account whenever possible as well as the times you specified that you will be arriving at and leaving the conference. You will also have the opportunity to specify when you are presenting a paper or poster. Given those constraints we will make our schedule.

We recognize that things may change and will do our best to make changes as needed. In return, we ask that you be as flexible as possible since coordinating a conference is challenging and your role is important!

### Do I have to be there for the whole conference to be a student volunteer?

No. We realize that travel plans and other commitments exist. We hope that students local to the conference area will be flexible. In particular, there is always a need for volunteers on Tuesday and Wednesday, before most of the conference activities begin, before many of the traveling student volunteers have arrived, and the final Saturday of the conference for workshops. We encourage local student volunteers to be available on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.

### Can I get funding for travel or hotel expenses?

The conference itself does not provide funding for student volunteers, but you may be able to get some support through your department or through another source at your university. You should print your registration acknowledgment to show to potential funding sources.
