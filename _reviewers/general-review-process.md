This document describes the general review process for submission types listed below (grouped by submission date):

* [**Group 1**](#group-1-timeline): [Panels](/reviewers/panel-review-guidelines), [Special Sessions](/reviewers/special-sessions-review-guidelines), [Workshops](/reviewers/workshop-review-guidelines)
* [**Group 2**](#group-2-timeline): 
[ACM Student Research Competition](/reviewers/src-review-guidelines), 
[BoFs](/reviewers/bofs-review-guidelines), 
[Demos](/reviewers/demos-review-guidelines), 
[Lightning talks](/reviewers/lt-review-guidelines), 
[Nifty Assignments](/reviewers/nifty-review-guidelines), and
[Posters](/reviewers/poster-review-guidelines)  

**If you are reviewing for [Papers](/authors/papers), please refer** to the [Paper Review Process](/reviewers/paper-review-process) and [Paper Review Guidelines](/reviewers/paper-review-guidelines).

Reviewers provide high-quality reviews for submissions to provide authors with feedback so they may improve their work for presentation or future submission. Reviewers are expected to provide constructive, specific comments in reviews that support numeric indicators.  

Panels, Special Sessions, and Workshops will receive 3 reviews while all Group 2 submissions will receive 2 reviews.

All reviews are submitted through EasyChair. Reviewers are considered "Ordinary PC members" in EasyChair.

Submissions to Lightning Talks and Posters undergo a dual-anonymous review process and thus authors must anonymize submissions. All other submissions covered in this document are not anonymized and will undergo a single-anonymous review process where Reviewers are anonymous to each other and to the authors.

The Track Chairs of each track will lead any discussion and will make recommendations of acceptance of submissions to the Program Chairs.

As a Reviewer, you will need to:
- [update your Reviewer profile](#reviewer-profile), 
- review author guidelines for the track you are reviewing, 
- Optionally (as determined by the track chair) [bid on papers you're interested in reviewing](#bid), 
- read and [review](#review) the assigned submissions, and 
- [discuss each assigned submission with the track chairs](#discussion).

### Reviewer Profile

When you receive your invitation to review for SIGCSE TS 2021, please take a few moments to update your profile and select 3-5 topics that you are most qualified for reviewing.  To do so, select **SIGCSE TS 2021 > My topics** from the menu.  

Please check at most 5 topics! More topics will make it harder for the EasyChair system to make a good set of matches. 

### Bid

You may have a bidding period as set up by the Track Chair. If so, please bid within the specified time window. If you do not bid, we will use topics to assign submissions for review.

After the submission deadline and before reviewing can begin, Reviewers will bid on submissions they are interested in reviewing. Please bid for submissions where the title and abstract are in your area of expertise. Bidding will help with assigning submissions for review that you're qualified and interested in reviewing!

### Review

Before starting your review, you may be asked by the Track Chairs to bid on submissions and/or declare conflicts with any submitting authors. Please do so in a timely manner so we can avoid conflicts during assignment.

As a **Reviewer**, we ask that you carefully read each submission assigned to you and write a constructive review that concisely summarizes what you believe the submission to be about. When reviewing a submission, consider:

* the strengths and weaknesses, 
* the contribution to an outstanding SIGCSE TS 2021 program and experience for attendees, and
* how it brings new ideas or extends current ideas through replication to the field and to practitioners and researchers of computing education.

Track specific Reviewer guidelines are available:

* [**Group 1**](#group-1-timeline): [Panels](/reviewers/panel-review-guidelines), [Special Sessions](/reviewers/special-sessions-review-guidelines), [Workshops](/reviewers/workshop-review-guidelines)
