## Overview
 
[Posters](/authors/posters) provide an opportunity for an **informal presentation** featuring “give and take” with conference attendees. Presenting a poster is also a good way in which to discuss and receive feedback on **work in progress** that has not been fully developed into a paper.
 
Posters should not be previously published, as a paper or a poster.
 
Poster submissions will be reviewed using the dual-anonymous review process (see below).

## Review Guidelines
 
Keep in mind that posters are meant to be a place to present and receive feedback on work that is in progress. Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.
Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work, provide their familiarity with the submission topic, describe the expected audience, identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions, and provide an overall evaluation. Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
