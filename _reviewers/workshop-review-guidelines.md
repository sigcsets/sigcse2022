## Overview
 
[Workshops](/authors/workshops) provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest, and should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful. To this end, workshop presenters should provide participants with handouts, online materials, or other tangible documents/ artifacts outlining and/or supporting the workshop material.

### Reviews
 
SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshop proposals are reviewed within EasyChair. Please ensure that you have followed all of the guidelines in the [General Review Process](/reviewers/general-review-process).
 
As stated in the general review guidelines, “[r]eviewers provide high-quality reviews for submissions to provide authors with feedback so they may improve their work for presentation or future submission[s].” As such, please ensure that all criticism is phrased in a constructive manner.
 
Your overall recommendation should focus on significance and relevance, anticipated interest, and quality. In assessing significance and relevance, your primary resource should be the “Significance and Relevance of the Topic” section of the proposal. Similarly, in assessing anticipated interest, you should pay particular attention to the “Expected Audience” section. Finally, in assessing quality, you should consider all sections except “Space and Enrollment Restrictions” and “Audio/Visual Requirements.” The program and track chairs will consider these sections and the availability of appropriate facilities, as well as feedback on, and attendance at, similar workshops that have been offered in previous years
 
In addition, feedback on, and attendance at, similar workshops that have been offered in previous years may be taken into account. This is particularly relevant for workshops that propose repeating or extending a previously offered workshop.
