## Overview
 
<!-- Opening paragraphs are the same as authors guidelines -->
[Demos](/authors/demos) provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting. Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential, and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. 

Since SIGCSE TS 2022 is planned to be held as an on-site event, Demos will take place during break periods and will last 45 minutes. This follows the Demo format as used traditionally until the SIGCSE TS 2020. Thus physical presence of at least one of the presenters at the conference site is mandatory. However, we expect there will be virtual attendees as well. The proposals must clearly state how the Demo would be run on-site and either suggest a plan to accommodate remote attendees or explain why this would not be feasible.

## Review Guidelines
 
As you write your review, please keep in mind that the Demos are meant to be interactive.  Do the authors describe how they plan to engage with attendees?  Do the proposed **activities fit into the 45-minute time frame**? Are the timing details given and reasonable? Have the authors considered the situation of attendees arriving late and/or attending virtually? Is the subject of interest to the SIGCSE TS audience? Does the Demo satisfy a timely need? 
 
Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.
 
Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work, provide their familiarity with the submission topic, describe the expected audience, identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions, and provide an overall evaluation.  Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
