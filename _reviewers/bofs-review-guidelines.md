## Overview
 
[Birds-of-a-Feather](/authors/bofs) Sessions provide an environment for colleagues with similar interests to meet for informal discussion. Proposers of BOF sessions should serve as discussion leaders only. BOFs are not intended to be presentations.

### Review Guidelines
 
SIGCSE Technical Symposium BOF proposals are reviewed within EasyChair. Please ensure that you have followed all of the guidelines in the [General Review Process](/reviewers/general-review-process).
 
In addition to the general review process, indicate in your review whether the proposed activity/structure is reasonable with respect to a hybrid BOF.
