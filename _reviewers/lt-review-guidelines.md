## Overview
 
[Lightning Talks](/authors/lightningtalks) describe works in progress (tentative or preliminary work), new and untested ideas (ideas for possible work), or opportunities for collaborative work. Presentations of mature work will not be considered. The purpose of a Lightning Talk can be to start a discussion, find collaborators, or receive input and critique about an idea. Proposals are limited to 500 words, including the abstract of 250 words, and will be **reviewed with a dual-anonymous process** for acceptance. Lightning Talk presentations will be a maximum of 5 minutes each. For virtual presentations, the presenter may provide a pre-recorded video of their presentation.

## Review Guidelines
 
As you write your review, please keep in mind that Lightning Talks are meant to describe works in progress, new ideas or opportunities. Judge the proposal based on the following questions: Does the proposed **talk fit into the 5-minute time frame**? Is the subject of interest to the SIGCSE TS audience? Does the talk present a timely and innovative idea? Is it clear what the proposer intends to gain from presenting the talk?
In the event that a proposal contains a link to a website with supplementary materials, reviewers should not consider these materials in their review as the abstract should be self-contained and sufficient.
Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.
Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work, provide their familiarity with the submission topic, describe the expected audience, identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions, and provide an overall evaluation.  Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
