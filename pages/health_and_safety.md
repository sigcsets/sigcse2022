## SIGCSE TS 2022 (TS 2022) will be an In-Person Event with Full Remote Participation Available

TS 2022 will take place March 2-5, 2022, with the in-person component in Providence, RI, USA, and the virtual component hosted on the Pathable platform (see the [Participant Information](/participants) page). The TS 2022 committee is dedicated to providing the community with the best possible conference experience for all participants regardless of the modality of their participation.

The health and safety of the TS 2022 family — participants and volunteers alike — remains a top priority. With a focus on coming together safely this March, we will be implementing the safety protocols below for all in-person participants. These are based on the policies and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) (e.g., [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html)), and the state of Rhode Island ([https://covid.ri.gov/](https://covid.ri.gov/)), as well as the requirements of the Association of Computing Machinery and the SIGCSE Board.

## Proof of Vaccination

If you are considering attending TS 2022 in-person, please visit our [Getting Ready: SIGCSE TS 2022 In-Person Participation](/participants/in-person-getting-ready/) web page ASAP for details about having your vaccination verified in advance. In order to participate in TS 2022 in-person activities, all in-person participants, exhibitors, volunteers, and staff must have their COVID-19 vaccination verified in advance. The registration and verification process occurs over the span of two or more days. Approved vaccines for TS 2022 include all those approved by either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), or the national health authority of the country where they are administered. Participants are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the last dose of their vaccine series.

## Before You Travel

We will continue to closely monitor specific travel advisories through official channels, which include WHO and the CDC, as well as safety guidelines at the local and state levels.

Before traveling to the conference, we recommend that you stay informed of any information your local health agencies may make available and take reasonable precautions to protect yourself. TS 2022 continues to closely monitor this dynamic situation and will provide updates with any developments and reserves the right to make changes as needed.

## On-Site Safety Protocols

__Face Coverings:__ Masks will be required during all TS 2022 activities.
