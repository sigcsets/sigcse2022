## SIGCSE TS 2022 Is Planning for an In-Person Event & Remote Participation

The SIGCSE TS 2022 committee is dedicated to providing the community with the best possible conference experience for all participants. SIGCSE TS 2022 continues to plan to meet in person March 2-5, 2022 in Providence, RI, USA. For those who may be unable to travel to Providence, please watch for the Remote Participation FAQ and review the SIGCSE TS 2022 Registration page for the most up to date information.

We are working to produce an event that will be every bit as creative, inspiring, and meaningful as past SIGCSE Technical Symposia — whether you choose to participate in-person or remotely. We appreciate your support, and look forward to seeing you in March.

### On-Site Safety Protocols

The health and safety of the SIGCSE TS 2022 family — participants and volunteers alike — remains a top priority. With a focus on coming together safely this March, we will be implementing the safety protocols below for all in-person attendees. These are based on the policies and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) (e.g., https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) as well as those of the state of Rhode Island (https://covid.ri.gov/).

#### Proof of Vaccination

SIGCSE TS 2022 will require all in-person attendees, exhibitors, volunteers, and SIGCSE TS 2022 staff to show proof of full vaccination. You are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the last dose in your vaccine series. In order to pick up your registration badge, you must provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination from one of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or World Health Organization (WHO) approved vaccines.  

#### Additional Protocols

__Face Coverings:__ Mask will be required during all TS 2022 activities.

__Social Distancing:__ Space planning in all meeting rooms will include social distancing.

SIGCSE TS 2022 may enforce additional requirements, particularly to align with CDC guidelines for masking and social distancing at the time of the meeting.

__Hygiene:__ Non-contact hand sanitizer dispensers have been placed throughout the Rhode Island Convention Center.  Although nothing replaces washing our hands with soap and water, these hand sanitizer dispensers are available for the convenience of all who attend events at the convention center.

__Cleaning:__ Prior to every event, trained staff will follow CDC and local guidelines on the cleaning and disinfecting of all areas including touch points (handrails, seats, restrooms, etc.). The Environmental Hygiene program was developed with guidance from CDC, NHS, PHAA, WHO and experts in hygiene.

### Before You Travel

We will continue to closely monitor specific travel advisories through official channels, which include WHO and the CDC, as well as safety guidelines at the local and state levels.

Before traveling to the conference, we recommend that you stay informed of any information your local health agencies may make available and take reasonable precautions to protect yourself. SIGCSE TS 2022 continues to closely monitor this dynamic situation and will provide updates with any developments and reserves the right to make changes as needed.
