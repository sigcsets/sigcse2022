### The Premier Event in Computer Science Education
#### About ACM SIGCSE
The Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGCSE) is a community of approximately 2,600 people who, in addition to their specialization within computing, have a strong interest in the quality of computing education.

#### About the SIGCSE Technical Symposium
The SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and is the organizationâ€™s flagship conference. It has been held annually in February or March in North America since 1970. The SIGCSE organization provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy.

#### SIGCSE Technical Symposium Attendees
The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is regularly attended by more than 1,800 people
from around the globe. Conference attendees are looking for new ideas, textbooks to support their courses, and resources to improve the effectiveness of their teaching. Course related software and hardware systems are of great interest. With increased pressure to pursue online learning and asynchronous learning, attendees will want to find out about the latest innovations in web authoring tools and class management systems.
In addition to selecting the textbooks and support materials for their courses, conference attendees influence the choice of computing equipment for their laboratories as well as for their departments. They select the tools that support teaching and their own scholarly work. They also determine what languages will be used in their courses and what compilers and development environments will be installed. These professionals set aside the time of the Technical Symposium to review what is available and make their choices for the coming years. This is the most efficient way to interact with the most active teaching faculty in computing and information science.
