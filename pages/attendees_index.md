## Post-Conference Access to Pathable
The SIGCSE TS 2021 chairs are working with the SIGCSE board to investigate offering post-conference access to the materials in Pathable.  More will be posted and announce as decisions are made.

Note that anyone that already has purchased full registration to the 2021 Technical Symposium (prior to March 20, 2021) will continue to have access to Pathable until March 2022 and can login with the Pathable link in the nav menu above.

## Hybrid Experience
Program content will be delivered in a hybrid modality, with the virtual component hosted on Pathable. Specifically, presenters may participate either in-person or remotely. Selected presentations will be live-streamed to remote participants, including the keynote addresses, panels, special sessions, and nifty assignments. All papers, lightning talks, demos, and posters will have a pre-recorded video on the online platform. Authors of in-person presentations that are not live-streamed will be online at specific times in the Authors’ Corner, where they will be available to discuss their work.


## Accessibility
The SIGCSE community is becoming increasingly diverse, with attendees from all over the world who represent varied gender, racial, ethnic, disability, and other identities. This set of Frequently Asked Questions is here to help you navigate accessibility at the conference. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact the Accessibility Liaison, Mohsen Dorodchi, at [accessibility@sigcse2022.org](mailto:accessibility@sigcse2022.org).

### Q: Is there a room for nursing mothers?
**A:** Yes. There is a room for nursing on the fifth floor of the convention center next to room 557.  This room is equipped with a refrigerator and full bathroom.  Please see the Registration Desk to obtain the key.

### Q: What if I experience harassment at the conference?
**A:** In accordance with the [ACM Conference Policy](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment), harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at SIGCSE TS 2022. If you have been harassed or you witness harassment, please contact the conference chairs ([symposium@sigcse2022.org](mailto:symposium@sigcse2022.org) .  If you prefer to report behavior anonymously this can be done using the [ACM form for Reporting violations of the ACM Policy Against Harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/reporting-unacceptable-behavior), which supports anonymous reporting.

The 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education Hybrid Event will be held at the [Rhode Island Convention Center](http://www.riconvention.com) and [Omni Providence Hotel](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/providence)  in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. 

* Pre-Symposium Affiliated Events: March 2
* Workshops: March 2, 4, and 5
* Technical Symposium: March 2-5
* Virtual Platform Opens: TBD

The SIGCSE TS 2022 organizing committee is excited to offer options for participants to participate virtually or travel to Providence and attend the conference in person. We hope to have an exciting and engaging experience for all participants, and hope very much to see many of you in person.  Recognizing that participants need information to make decisions about travel and gathering, we will keep this site updated with information as it is available.  Our registration system will allow you to switch your own registration between in-person and virtual participation, but keep in mind the discount dates.  The cost for your new registration will be based on the date you change it, not the date when you first registered.

### Cancellation Policy
<p><strong>Cancellation requests must be made by March 1, 2022 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time.</strong> A processing fee of US$100 will be assessed for full rate registrations. A processing fee of US$25 will be assessed for reduced rate and virtual registrations. Regrettably, cancellations received after that date cannot be honored. The conference committee recognizes that sometimes last-minute cancellations can't be avoided due to weather, travel disruptions, and/or health issues. However, the conference incurs expenses for which it is liable based on registration counts. In-person registrants are strongly advised to purchase travel insurance to cover their non-refundable expenses. Also, registrants who find themselves unable to attend should be aware that registrations are transferable, but in general the conference committee cannot assist in finding an appropriate recipient.</p>

<p><strong>In the event that the Symposium is cancelled due to circumstances beyond the organizers' control,</strong> refunds are not guaranteed. If refunds are issued, the amount will depend on the expenses and financial commitments incurred by the Symposium as of the cancellation date.</p>


## On-Site Student Volunteers 
Student volunteers are an important part of the SIGCSE Symposium and have been for many years. Student volunteers are on-site attendees attending the physical conference who are full-time undergraduate or graduate students. Each volunteer works for 9 hours (or less, as assigned), helping with various conference management activities. You'll interact with the conference organizers and presenters and will meet other students from all over the world. [More information about the experience, the benefits, and how to sign up are provided here](/participants/studentvolunteers).


## Carbon Offsets
ACM SIGCSE makes it is easy for attendees to offset their carbon footprint to the ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium through the registration process. Donations will be passed directly to <a href="https://www.cooleffect.org/">Cool Effect</a>, an organization that helps individuals and businesses develop practical and cost-effective solutions to slow, stop, and reduce the climate crisis. During the registration process, you will see a check box option that will allow you to make a donation to offset your emissions from attending the symposium. This contribution is optional and distinct from the registration fee and will appear as such on your registration receipt. Please consult your organization in advance to determine if the expense is reimbursable. If you need to use different credit cards for your registration and your donation, you can simply log in again after registering, update your registration, and pay with a second credit card. ACM will forward the names of the individuals that contribute along with the amount of their contribution to Cool Effect who will acknowledge the contribution to the individual donor for tax purposes.  You can utilize the <a href="https://www.cooleffect.org/content/travel-offset">carbon offset calculator</a> to make the appropriate donation based on travel and lodging.

## KidsCamp
Unfortunately, due to the uncertainty of travel and lack of vaccine availability for children under 5, we are unable to offer Kids' Camp this year.


<!-- 
## Workshops

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest. A successful workshop should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful in the classroom.

All workshops will take place the Saturday and Sunday before the Technical Symposium starts as a part of "Workshop Weekend."  Like the Symposium itself, workshops will take place in Zoom meeting rooms through Pathable and will appear on the Pathable schedule of registrants.  

Each workshop will be three hours long.  A workshop fee is required and can be paid when you register for the Technical Symposium or can be added afterward if you choose to modify your registration.  _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 workshop._

#### Affiliated Events

Affiliated Events are an excellent venue for SIGCSE TS sub-communities or groups to arrange a time to gather and present or discuss topics of interest. This year's slate of affiliated events highlight existing and emerging subfields, engage groups of diversity, and bring together communities of practice.

Affiliated events will take place in Pathable as the virtual platform. _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 affilated event._ See each individual affiliated event for information on registering. Some events require prior application or submission. For any questions related to affiliated events, please contact the organizers directly.

#### Special Events

Special events are sessions that take place outside the regular SIGCSE TS program and have been invited by the Symposium Chairs and/or the SIGCSE Board. These special events provide another way to engage with others at the Technical Symposium. _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 special event._ See each individual affiliated event for information on registering. For any questions related to affiliated events, please contact the organizers directly.
