## Post-Conference Access to Pathable
The SIGCSE TS 2021 chairs are working with the SIGCSE board to investigate offering post-conference access to the materials in Pathable.  More will be posted and announce as decisions are made.

Note that anyone that already has purchased full registration to the 2021 Technical Symposium (prior to March 20, 2021) will continue to have access to Pathable until March 2022 and can login with the Pathable link in the nav menu above.

The 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education hybrid event will be held in early March 2022. The in-person component will take place at the [Rhode Island Convention Center](http://www.riconvention.com) and [Omni Providence Hotel](https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/providence) in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. The virtual component will be hosted on [Pathable](https://sigcse2022.us2.pathable.com/).

We are very excited to provide our community with a technical symposium supporting both virtual and in-person participation.  We have done our best to design a conference that is engaging and open to all. Part of being open to all is keeping costs down, which means that we will have some sessions with both in-person and virtual participation, while others will have only in-person participation or only virtual participation. Plenary sessions, including keynote presentations, will be among those with both in-person and virtual participation, as will all panels and special sessions.

We ask for your patience and constructive feedback while we find a way to offer the symposium to all who are interested.  If you are like us, you will have questions. This page and its links are here to help you navigate this years offering!

## Hybrid Experience: What to Know/Expect

### The Big Picture
Program content will be delivered in a hybrid modality, with the virtual component hosted on Pathable. Specifically, presenters may participate either in-person or remotely. Selected presentations will be live-streamed to remote participants, including the keynote addresses, panels, special sessions, and nifty assignments. All papers, lightning talks, demos, and posters will have a pre-recorded video on the online platform. Authors of in-person presentations that are not live-streamed will be online at specific times in the Authors’ Corner, where they will be available to discuss their work.

Whether you are participating virtually or in person, please read more about what to expect with respect to Pathable and how to get the most out of your [TS 2022 Pathable experience](/participants/pathable).

### Participants Registered for In-Person Participation

The world has changed since we last met in-person, and preparing for conference participation is more complicated than it used to be. As mentioned above, you will want to customize your Pathable account. Most importantly, you will also need to have your COVID-19 vaccination status verified, preferably (by far) before you arrive onsite. You'll want to pack a few new items, too. Finally, some new procedures will be in place once we're onsite, especially on our first day at the conference venue. All of these topics are discussed on our page about [getting ready](/participants/in-person-getting-ready).

Beyond changes in how we prepare for conference participation, you might be wondering how the TS 2022 program content will be delivered. What content will be in-person, hybrid, and virtual-only? How will participants with in-person registration participate in sessions with each of these modalities. For answers, see our page about the [program experience for participants with in-person registration](/participants/in-person-program-experience).

**A:** No, there is not an induction loop. However, special hearing devices can be hooked into the sound system if the convention center and AV company is informed of your needs in advance.  Please email [accessibility@sigcse2022.org](mailto:accessibility@sigcse2022.org) if you require this.


## Hotel and Travel Information          
Once you have [chosen whether to arrive by plane, train, automobile](https://www.goprovidence.com/sigcse/getting-here/), or some combination thereof, [reserve your room](https://www.goprovidence.com/sigcse/hotel-information/) at the Omni Providence or one of the other fine conference hotels. The Omni is the 2022 SIGCSE Technical Symposium headquarters hotel and connected to the Rhode Island Convention Center by an enclosed skybridge.

Make your room reservation by Feb 7 to ensure the SIGCSE discounted rate. Hotel rooms and rates are based on availability.


### Roommate Database
The [SIGCSE TS 2022 Roommate Finder](https://app.miniextensions.com/form/HQQb5whwEXxH4RqmnHcp) database's purpose is to support in-person SIGCSE TS participants who are looking for others wanting to share hotel rooms. It stores your relevant information, including travel dates and contact details, as well as whether you already have a hotel room reserved or not. It then allows you to search for potential matching roommates.  It is an information resource only. Actually contacting potential roommates and determining compatibility is up to you. Once you and a roommate agree to share, please follow the instructions provided to remove yourself from the active list of roommate seekers.


### Visas
<strong>Letters from ACM in support of visa applications:</strong> ACM is able to provide visa support letters for in-person participation to participants as well as authors with accepted papers, posters, or members of the conference committee. For visa support letters, you must first [register](/participants#registration) for the event. Then send your request to <supportletters@acm.org> with the following information.
<ol>
<li>Name and mailing address as it appears on your passport.</li>
<li>The name of the conference you wish to attend.</li>

<center style="margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<h3><a href="https://cvent.me/17lVE2">Registration is now open here.</a></h3>
</center>

The SIGCSE TS 2022 organizing committee is excited to offer options for participants to participate virtually or travel to Providence and attend the conference in person. We hope to have an exciting and engaging experience for all participants, and hope very much to see many of you in person.  Recognizing that participants need information to make decisions about travel and gathering, we will keep this site updated with information as it is available.  **Our registration system will allow you to switch your own registration between in-person and virtual participation, but keep in mind the discount dates.  The cost for your new registration will be based on the date you change it, not the date when you first registered.**

For assistance with registration, contact our fabulous [Registration Team](registration@sigcse2022.org).

### Cancellation Policy
<p><strong>Cancellation requests must be made by March 1, 2022 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time.</strong> A processing fee of US$100 will be assessed for full rate registrations. A processing fee of US$25 will be assessed for reduced rate and virtual registrations. Regrettably, cancellations received after that date cannot be honored. The conference committee recognizes that sometimes last-minute cancellations can't be avoided due to weather, travel disruptions, and/or health issues. However, the conference incurs expenses for which it is liable based on registration counts. In-person registrants are strongly advised to purchase travel insurance to cover their non-refundable expenses. Also, registrants who find themselves unable to attend should be aware that registrations are transferable, but in general the conference committee cannot assist in finding an appropriate recipient.</p>

<p><strong>In the event that the Symposium is cancelled due to circumstances beyond the organizers' control,</strong> refunds are not guaranteed. If refunds are issued, the amount will depend on the expenses and financial commitments incurred by the Symposium as of the cancellation date.</p>


## On-Site Student Volunteers
Student volunteers are an important part of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and have been for many years. Student volunteers are in-person participants who are full-time undergraduate or graduate students. Each volunteer works for 9 hours (or less, as assigned), helping with various symposium management activities. You'll interact with the symposium organizers and presenters and will meet other students from all over the world. More information about the experience, the benefits, and how to sign up are provided below.


### How do I register to volunteer?

Registering for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium as a student volunteer is a two-step process.

-   **STEP 1**: [Register as a volunteer](http://sigcsesv.cs.virginia.edu) with the student volunteers team. As part of this process, you will provide your availability for volunteer shifts. Please look at the schedule and ensure that you do NOT select a shift where 1) you have a symposium commitment like presenting a paper or the ACM Student Research Competition, or 2) you want to see a particular talk. You can update your availability for shifts until February 9.

After completing STEP 1, you will receive a discount code that you can use to register for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium in STEP 2. The discount code can be found on your profile page on the student volunteer website. The discount code makes the base symposium registration fee free, but you are still responsible for paying all the add-on costs.

It is important that you complete your volunteer profile and provide availability on the student volunteer website. Otherwise, your discount code for the symposium registration will be cancelled.


-   **STEP 2**: SEPARATELY register for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium as a student.
When you get to the check out page, you can use the discount code from STEP 1 to zero out the base symposium registration fee. Note you will need to pay the costs of any additions to registration (e.g., workshops).

Please note that while in previous years we have been able to accept everyone who registered in January and often anyone interested, we cannot guarantee that this is the case every year. Please try to register as early as possible (you can provide your availability for shifts closer to the symposium start as we understand that it can take a little while to arrange travel).

Also, please note that if you are no longer able to attend, we greatly appreciate you going back to the student volunteer registration system to cancel and emailing [volunteers@sigcse2022.org](mailto:volunteers@sigcse2022.org). Failing to do so leaves us scrambling at the last minute to find a replacement for your assigned duties, and will result in notification of your designated faculty advisor.

### What To Do Once at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium

Upon arrival at the symposium site, you must check in at the main SIGCSE Technical Symposium Registration Desk to receive your symposium registration packet. Then visit the Student Volunteer Office to check in and to receive any needed instructions or updates.

Not completing all your assigned shifts will result in the revocation of your symposium registration and notification of your on-site faculty advisor. You would then need to pay the registration fee to continue attending the symposium at the on-site registration rate.


### Institutional Coordinators

*SIGCSE Technical Symposium Student Volunteer Policy for schools that send five or more undergraduate student volunteers to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium*

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium relies on its student volunteer corps for its success. Hence, we are particularly grateful to the schools that bring larger cohorts of student volunteers. To ensure the best experience for student volunteers, institution faculty, and the Student Volunteer Coordinators, schools that provide five or more undergraduate student volunteers must designate a single Institutional Coordinator for all the student volunteers from that institution who must fulfill the following responsibilities.

-   The Institutional Coordinator must attend the SIGCSE Technical Symposium in-person and be available via cell phone and email during the symposium.
-   When possible, the Institutional Coordinator should accompany the volunteers to the Student Volunteer Headquarters when the students check in.
-   The Institutional Coordinator must attest to the ability of each of their students to accomplish the tasks expected of student volunteers. If appropriate, the contact may also meet with one of the Student Volunteer Coordinators for a confidential discussion of roles that might prove difficult for a student so that we can identify more appropriate roles.

If an institution does not designate a coordinator, we may limit the number of volunteers from that institution. In addition, schools that do not designate an Institutional Coordinator or whose students do not perform their tasks reliably risk losing Student Volunteer privileges in future years.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Who is eligible to be a student volunteer?

Any full-time student may become a student volunteer. (You must be a currently registered student at your institution!) Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. You must specify your school affiliation and a faculty member who will be on-site during the symposium when you sign up as a volunteer. Students attending the symposium for the ACM Student Research Competition are encouraged to become volunteers as well. Email [volunteers@sigcse2022.org](mailto:volunteers@sigcse2022.org) if you have further questions.

#### What if I require a visa?

See the [visa subsection](/participants#visas) of the travel information above for information about requesting a letter of support from ACM for you visa.

#### What are the benefits of student volunteering?

In exchange for 9 hours (or less, as assigned) of volunteer service, you will receive:

-   Complimentary symposium registration
-   Student registration for the symposium includes student membership in [SIGCSE](https://sigcse.org/membership/benefits.html)
-   A chance to meet and work with students from other schools
-   Entrance to the student volunteer party
-   Professional development workshops facilitated by faculty members specifically for student volunteers
-   The opportunity to contribute to an effort to improve computing education... and our sincere gratitude for your efforts!

Note that in addition to these benefits, since you are a registered SIGCSE Technical Symposium student attendee, you have all the rights of the non-volunteer student participants:

-   Access to all sessions, including papers, panels, seminars, and birds-of-a-feather discussions
-   Access to all exhibits where book publishers and software vendors have displays and activities
-   All symposium "coffee" breaks (some food and drink)
-   The main symposium reception on Thursday evening (typically includes *hors d'oeuvres* and a cash bar)
-   The symposium luncheon on Saturday afternoon

#### What kinds of work will I do as a student volunteer?

It varies. Duties may include (and are not limited to) the following:

-   You may work at the registration booth organizing attendee packets.
-   You may monitor the exhibit hall or reception entrance to ensure those entering have the appropriate symposium badge.
-   You may count the participants at various symposium sessions.
-   You may assist speakers at various session types with handouts or equipment.

#### Do I have a say in what work I do as a student volunteer?

We will try to accommodate your preferences to the extent possible; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy every volunteer's preferences. If you have a skill we are interested in, then you get a chance to indicate that when you are indicating available work times, e.g. working with children might make you a great choice to help with Kids Camp! (Unfortunately you'll have to wait for SIGCSE TS 2023 for that particular opportunity.) We also try to accommodate students who have a preference for a particular shift or session, but due to the complexity of scheduling and ensuring we have adequate coverage at all sessions, we cannot guarantee anything.

#### When during the symposium will I do my student volunteer work?

This will depend on symposium needs; some time periods are busier than others. Your duties may be broken into separate time periods and even across separate days. We guarantee no more than 9 hours of assigned work per volunteer.

Please note that we'll take your preferences into account whenever possible as well as the times you specified that you will be arriving at and leaving the symposium. You will also have the opportunity to specify when you are presenting a paper or poster. Given those constraints we will make our schedule.

We recognize that things may change and will do our best to make changes as needed. In return, we ask that you be as flexible as possible since coordinating a symposium is challenging and your role is important!

#### Do I have to be there for the whole symposium to be a student volunteer?

No. We realize that travel plans and other commitments exist. We hope that students local to the symposium area will be flexible. In particular, there is always a need for volunteers on Tuesday and Wednesday, before most of the symposium activities begin and before many of the traveling student volunteers have arrived, as well as the final Saturday of the symposium, for workshops. Thus, we encourage local student volunteers to be available on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday.

#### Can I get funding for travel or hotel expenses?

The symposium is unable to provide travel support for student volunteers other than in-kind support in the form of complementary registration. However, you may be able to get additional support through your department or another source at your university. Be sure to save or print your registration confirmation to show to potential funding sources.

## Workshops

Workshops provide an in-depth review of, or introduction to, a topic of interest. A successful workshop should provide participants with materials and/or ideas that are immediately useful in the classroom.

All workshops will take place the Saturday and Sunday before the Technical Symposium starts as a part of "Workshop Weekend."  Like the Symposium itself, workshops will take place in Zoom meeting rooms through Pathable and will appear on the Pathable schedule of registrants.  

Each workshop will be three hours long.  A workshop fee is required and can be paid when you register for the Technical Symposium or can be added afterward if you choose to modify your registration.  _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 workshop._

#### Affiliated Events

Affiliated Events are an excellent venue for SIGCSE TS sub-communities or groups to arrange a time to gather and present or discuss topics of interest. This year's slate of affiliated events highlight existing and emerging subfields, engage groups of diversity, and bring together communities of practice.

Affiliated events will take place in Pathable as the virtual platform. _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 affilated event._ See each individual affiliated event for information on registering. Some events require prior application or submission. For any questions related to affiliated events, please contact the organizers directly.

<a href="{{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/affiliatedevents">List of Affiliated Events</a>

#### Special Events

Special events are sessions that take place outside the regular SIGCSE TS program and have been invited by the Symposium Chairs and/or the SIGCSE Board. These special events provide another way to engage with others at the Technical Symposium. _Symposium registration is required to attend any SIGCSE TS 2021 special event._ See each individual affiliated event for information on registering. For any questions related to affiliated events, please contact the organizers directly.
