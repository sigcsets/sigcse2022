### <a id="technical_writing"></a>Technical Writing for All Students

Wednesday, March 2
8:30 AM -12:00 PM<br>
Room: 554 A/B
Presenter: Barry Rosenberg, Tina Ornduff, Google

#### Sponsored by Google

Most engineering students don't realize that professional engineers spend much of their day writing. Communicating clearly and efficiently is often the key difference between a mediocre engineering career and a great engineering career. In 2015, Google created technical writing courses specifically aimed at software engineers. To everyone's surprise, these courses became popular. In fact, more than half of all Google software engineers have now taken at least part of a technical writing course. In 2020, Google released free versions of these courses externally. During this session, Barry Rosenberg and Tina Ornduff--two of the courses' creators--will describe the available resources and answer your questions about teaching technical writing principles to CS students.

Looking for some high-engagement options for teaching CS?  Join us for a fun, hands-on workshop where we’ll take a tour around MakeCode – exploring physical computing with the micro:bit, game development with MakeCode Arcade, and game modding with Minecraft!  We will walk through step-by-step coding challenges and build projects together that you can use in the classroom.  This is a beginner-level workshop – no prior experience required.  Attendees should bring a smile and a laptop to the session. Please note: this workshop will only be hosted in person.

### <a id = "abet"></a> How Should CS Programs Balance First-Job Readiness and Foundations for Long-Term Career Success?

Wednesday, March 2, 2022<br>

Presenters: Rajendra K. Raj, Rochester Institute of Technology,

It has been a long standing tradition for employers to complain that CS graduates lack many Day-1 job-readiness skills and for faculty to insist that academic programs should focus on long-lasting foundational material instead of trying to satisfy the multitude of short-term employer needs. If a CS undergraduate program was designed by employers of CS graduates, it would look considerably different from today’s academia-designed programs, as shown in the parallel education computing programs now being offered by several employers. This session asks several questions relevant to CS curricula: Is there a middle ground? Is there a principled approach to addressing the balance? How does one balance foundational concepts with practical skills? How would we know what is effective and what is not? Come join the discussion and
