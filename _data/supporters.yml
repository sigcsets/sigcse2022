      description: "As we near the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, artificial intelligence and machine learning are quietly sitting right at the intersection of the technical and social frontier. Facing 20th century biases being transformed into 21st century realities through these new technologies, AI and ML are an especially complex duo right at the nexus of science, ethics and justice. Fundamental questions arise here - what do students need to know to be effective guardians of fairness and justice in these fields? what are the fields that ought to be engaged beyond computation itself? how are communities armed to even understand the implications and embedded nature of these systems into our daily lives? This session brings together thought leaders who are grappling with this dilemma with the goal of moving the discussion beyond whether AI and ML are biased and whose fault it may be, to understanding how we engage at this new frontier as both educators and citizens."

      presenters: Frank Vahid (University of California, Riverside); Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona); Aubrey Lawson (zyBooks, A Wiley Brand CS/CE Content Developer)
      description: "Nearly 80% of instructors who use zyLabs auto-grader switched from grading programming assignments by hand. They saved an average of 9 hours per week, with some reporting up to 20 hours saved. In recent years, computer science educators have increasingly shifted how they grade programming assignments, from grading manually or using batch scripts, to using auto-graders with immediate score feedback to students. zyBooks has been a pioneer by developing the zyLabs auto-grader, that is easy to use and integrated with our state of the art e-learning platform. This shift illustrates a future with a much different classroom dynamic, in which students view instructors less as evaluators and more as hands-on educators.  To support educators in this new role, zyLabs also provides support across a wide range of activities by providing a library of high-quality pre-written programming assignments, an intuitive interface for customizing content, and tools to promote student integrity. In this session, we'll talk about the growth and benefits of zyLabs auto-grading, demonstrate our library of programming assignments, and illustrate how zyLabs features promote academic honesty."

      time: 4:15 PM (ET) - 5:30 PM (ET)
      presenters: Gerald Weiss (Turing's Craft, CUNY - Brooklyn College)
      description: "Whether integrated in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard, or as a standalone web client, CodeLab continues its role as a venue where students can work independently and without supervision to gain mastery over the syntax, semantics and common usage of the programming language elements of Java, Python, C++, etc. that are taught to CS1 students. Along with hosting instructor-created programming assignments, CodeLab offers hundreds of short programming exercises with high quality, immediate feedback that are focused on distinct language constructs or programming ideas. Each topic contains a sequence of incrementally increasingly complex exercises thus reducing the learning curve, so we believe that CodeLab is a must-have learning tool for introductory programming students. In this meeting, we will go over the essence of the core CodeLab service and then discuss strategies for faculty who wish to get the most out of the service for their students. We'll be talking about deadlines, customization, exercise creation, plagiarism, auto-grading and more."
