#      day: Tuesday, March 16
#      time: 3:00 PM (ET) - 4:15 PM (ET)
#      presenters: Amos Johnson (Morehouse College)
#      description: "Virginia Tech and Morehouse College are currently in the second semester of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP). This experiential learning effort involves creating a long-term, multi-college, and multidisciplinary undergraduate research project in the technical area of deep learning applied to wireless communications. Due to COVID-19, the project has morphed into a completely online experience, with GitHub as the communications focal point. This change in structure has provided unique challenges in ensuring continued student engagement, collaboration, and research output—along with some unintended benefits. In this presentation, you’ll get an overview of the program, goals and motivations, and current status. In addition, the speakers will provide a unique look at how COVID-19 has led to necessary improvements in collaboration as a beneficial long term side-effect. You’ll come away with best practices for engaging students from diverse colleges, disciplines, and backgrounds effectively while maximizing student engagement and outcomes, especially in pure, or hybrid, online settings."

#      day: Thursday, March 18
#      time: 3:00 PM (ET) - 4:15 PM (ET)
#      presenters: Jeff Olson (Director of Curriculum & Instruction, GitHub)
#      description: "Jeff has used Git & GitHub with students in both introductory and advanced high school courses, fine-tuning strategies for introducing Git in low-stakes and non-threatening ways and building to greater comfort & fluency over time. His strategies emphasize Git as a tool for project collaboration and personal organization, allowing Git to be integrated into your own projects & tasks no matter the programming language or IDE. Participants will see a lesson progression for developing understanding with Git & GitHub, including several Unplugged lesson ideas that can be done without computers. He'll also share his own journey through introducing Git to students, including pitfalls and strategies to avoid. Ultimately, even though Git is an industry standard tool for developers, Jeff doesn't think this should be the only reason for students to learn it; his goal is to describe strategies & resources that can motivate all students to see GitHub as a useful tool in their own journey through computer science, even if this doesn't lead directly into a career in software development."

#      presenters: "Kamau Bobb (Moderator - Google); Panelists: Ayanna Howard & Safiya Noble"
#      description: "As we near the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, artificial intelligence and machine learning are quietly sitting right at the intersection of the technical and social frontier. Facing 20th century biases being transformed into 21st century realities through these new technologies, AI and ML are an especially complex duo right at the nexus of science, ethics and justice. Fundamental questions arise here - what do students need to know to be effective guardians of fairness and justice in these fields? what are the fields that ought to be engaged beyond computation itself? how are communities armed to even understand the implications and embedded nature of these systems into our daily lives? This session brings together thought leaders who are grappling with this dilemma with the goal of moving the discussion beyond whether AI and ML are biased and whose fault it may be, to understanding how we engage at this new frontier as both educators and citizens."

#      presenters: Chris Stephenson (Google); Stephanie Marken (Gallup); Sloan Davis (Google); Sepi Moghadam (Google); Kyle Jennings (Google)
#      description: "Over the last few years, much work has been done by the CS education community to support and conduct rigorous education research that enables a greater understanding of how CS is best taught and learned. Given that post-secondary CS programs are operating significantly beyond capacity, and that many states are mandating CS for all K–12 students, our relatively small body of rigorous research is impinging on our capacity to best serve an increasing number of students.  This session focuses on how Google is supporting the growth of the CS research community and applying new standards and practices to its own programs. Attendees will learn about several programs that provide funding to encourage and support research and grow the future research pipeline as well as how Google conducts and uses education research to evaluate and improve its programs."

Then, we will add a rubric to give the students clear objectives and make grading explainable and consistent. Once we have an efficient manual environment set up, we will start adding basic automated tests to provide instant feedback to students and improve quality of code. Once comfortable with this, we will start increasing the complexity of the tests to further automate the grading process. Reducing the time spent marking allows the grader to focus on the important aspects of giving feedback to learners. Lastly, we will show you how to check for code plagiarism and analyze your assignment.<br><br>This session will show you from end to end how you would set up and convert an assignment to a powerful graded CodeGrade assignment."

#      presenters: Frank Vahid (University of California, Riverside); Roman Lysecky (University of Arizona); Aubrey Lawson (zyBooks, A Wiley Brand CS/CE Content Developer)
#      description: "Nearly 80% of instructors who use zyLabs auto-grader switched from grading programming assignments by hand. They saved an average of 9 hours per week, with some reporting up to 20 hours saved. In recent years, computer science educators have increasingly shifted how they grade programming assignments, from grading manually or using batch scripts, to using auto-graders with immediate score feedback to students. zyBooks has been a pioneer by developing the zyLabs auto-grader, that is easy to use and integrated with our state of the art e-learning platform. This shift illustrates a future with a much different classroom dynamic, in which students view instructors less as evaluators and more as hands-on educators.  To support educators in this new role, zyLabs also provides support across a wide range of activities by providing a library of high-quality pre-written programming assignments, an intuitive interface for customizing content, and tools to promote student integrity. In this session, we'll talk about the growth and benefits of zyLabs auto-grading, demonstrate our library of programming assignments, and illustrate how zyLabs features promote academic honesty."

#      time: 4:15 PM (ET) - 5:30 PM (ET)
#      presenters: Gerald Weiss (Turing's Craft, CUNY - Brooklyn College)
#      description: "Whether integrated in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard, or as a standalone web client, CodeLab continues its role as a venue where students can work independently and without supervision to gain mastery over the syntax, semantics and common usage of the programming language elements of Java, Python, C++, etc. that are taught to CS1 students. Along with hosting instructor-created programming assignments, CodeLab offers hundreds of short programming exercises with high quality, immediate feedback that are focused on distinct language constructs or programming ideas. Each topic contains a sequence of incrementally increasingly complex exercises thus reducing the learning curve, so we believe that CodeLab is a must-have learning tool for introductory programming students. In this meeting, we will go over the essence of the core CodeLab service and then discuss strategies for faculty who wish to get the most out of the service for their students. We'll be talking about deadlines, customization, exercise creation, plagiarism, auto-grading and more."
