    presenters : "Martin Fellenz, Mairead Brady and Michelle Macmahon"
    ad : "<p>This workshop is designed for educators in third level education who are looking for a teaching strategy to facilitate student self-regulated learning. Following the workshop, participants will have recognised the many opportunities for comparison activities in their teaching practice and have produced a first draft for implementing these. The workshop is broken into seven parts that include three interactive, collaborative activities, each lasting forty minutes. Fifteen minutes are allowed for introducing the three activities, and thirty minutes for workshop introduction and conclusion. The only equipment you will need in the workshop is pen and paper.</p>"

    title : "Efficient, Effective, and Ethical Education Research Data Management and Sustainability"
    presenters : "Monica McGill, Stacey Sexton, Alan Peterfreund and Maria Praetzellis"
    ad : "<p>Are you a proposal author, researcher thinking about data sharing, evaluator, or someone who just thinks that open science is neat? Then you’re not going to want to pass up this workshop. Over the course of three hours we’ll explore opportunities and challenges associated with preserving and sharing your data, review what the NSF requires of projects in their Data Management Plans, and explore tools that can help you think about your data sustainability strategy right now. Data sustainability is crucial to our contributions to the broader CS education research community, but also as a potential solution to the problem of needing more high quality datasets available for secondary analyses. There are several challenges associated with maintaining and sharing data, including practical considerations (e.g., sustainable funding, appropriate hosting platforms) and ethical concerns (e.g., confidentiality, appropriate contextualization of data in future usage). It is our responsibility to seriously engage with these difficulties and work towards responsible field-wide solutions. This workshop will 1) facilitate participants’ discussions of a data sustainability framework, with attention to practical and ethical challenges; 2) introduce participants to tools designed to help enable better data management and data management plans; and 3) allow time for participants to reflect on their current projects’ Data Management Plans and brainstorm ways to create the necessary processes for facilitating data sharing and sustainability. We invite you to bring plans you may have to the workshop.<p>"

    presenters : "Earl W. Huff Jr., Francisco Castro, Gayithri Jayathirtha, Yerika Jimenez, Minji Kong, Natalie Melo, Amber Solomon and Jennifer Tsan"
    ad : "<p>In what ways have we had to assimilate (or, in particular to structural racism, “whiten”) ourselves and our work into dominant ideals and narratives? In this workshop, we’ll take a look at how systems of power–such as structural racism, a system that upholds the ideology of white supremacy–permeate through our everyday lives and un/intentionally into our research. Grounding ourselves in a shared language, we will engage in a critical reflection of the impacts of these systems in our lives and work. We will examine what is considered central or “legitimate” in Computer Science Education (CSEd) research and work to understand how we knowingly and unknowingly perpetuate these systems ourselves. Striving towards a critical consciousness in the field, we invite graduate students and early-career (non-faculty) researchers to deeply engage in these questions as the beginning of envisioning what a CSEd that valued the multiple ways of knowing, doing, and being could look like.</p><p>In an effort to promote a safe space for discussions, this workshop’s audience will primarily focus on graduate students and early-career (non-faculty) researchers working in and across CSEd in some capacity (e.g., CSEd researchers in HCI, Learning Sciences, K-12 education, etc.).  Researchers whose work directly focuses on or intersects CSEd are welcome to attend. To participate, register for the workshop via the usual SIGCSE Technical Symposium registration process. We have a maximum of 40 slots for this workshop. This year, SIGCSE will be fully-online. Participants will need to have a computer with reliable Internet access to participate in the workshop. Further details regarding the workshop platform will be communicated to participants through email.</p>"

    title : "Using CSTA Standards for CS Teachers to Design CS Teacher Pathways"
    presenters : "Jennifer Rosato, Michelle Friend, Anne Leftwich and Louis Nadelson"
    ad : "<p>As primary and secondary computer science offerings expand across the United States and other countries, there is a growing demand for educators who can teach CS. One way to meet the demand is to include CS content and instruction in teacher preparation programs, at the inservice (practicing teachers) and/or preservice (becoming a teacher) levels. However, most education faculty do not have a background in computing and most CS faculty lack an understanding of education program components and their complex regulatory requirements. This workshop is designed for higher education faculty from CS and Education departments as well as teachers who support CS education programs and would like to learn more about creating pathways for preparing teachers to teach CS. The workshop will provide rationales for CS teacher preparation programs (including how to develop and sustain the programs), detail what teachers need to know and be able to do to teach CS, review dimensions and examples of existing programs, and share resources to support CS teacher preparation program development. Participants will have an opportunity in the last hour to work on developing a CS program for their institution and writing an action plan of 2-3 short term goals to support program development. This workshop is intended for those who are considering developing or at the early stages of developing programs to prepare computer science teachers. The workshop will address differences in preservice and inservice programs at undergraduate and graduate levels. If possible, participants may want to attend as a team of faculty from both computer science and education departments at their institution. Participants will need a laptop and are recommended to have a webcam and microphone to participate in virtual activities.</p>"

Join this workshop to learn just how easy it is to make engaging videos from your own home studio. Learn tips and tricks about microphone, camcorder, lights, and green screen selection and placement for all ranges of budgets. Learn best practices for pre-production, production and post-production (and what those words mean!). Completely transform yourself from a dimly-lit, barely-heard, fuzzy one-inch-square in the corner of an hour-long zoom presentation to a captivating speaker, using well-produced short video clips. The workshop is intended for anyone wishing to improve their home studio setup for video production: K-12 and university educators. After the workshop, you will have a palette of options to choose from, depending on your budget, to improve your configuration. No equipment needed, we are happy to welcome folks wishing to dip their toe into the space! However, if you’ve already started down the path, and have technical questions, we’re happy to welcome you as well, and will do our best to help.</p>"

    presenters : "John Clements, Zoe Wood, Aaron Keen and Zachary Rentz"
    ad : "<p>We have been teaching introductory computing wrong. Help us fix it!</p><p>Introductory computing courses too often focus on how to write code at the expense of explicitly teaching how to think about computation. And they very rarely focus on the ethical implications of computing. But before writing code to complete a task, we must consider the data that is available and how that data can be used or misused. Before writing code, we must consider how the end product can be used for both the intended task and for unforeseen tasks. Before writing code, we must ask not just ``how do we?'' but also ``should we?''.</p><p>Every student that studies computing must consider the social context of computing. This is particularly important for those students outside of the discipline that will have limited formal instruction on computing, but that will interact with and utilize computing artifacts in every aspect of their personal and professional lives.</p><p>This workshop offers attendees the opportunity to explore the commonality in thinking about computation and about the ethics of computing. Attendees will participate in multiple classroom-oriented ethics and computing discussion exercises and leave with models for leading such discussions.</p>"
