    ad: "Have you ever wondered how your feedback impacts your students and what you can do to improve it? In this workshop, we will discuss how feedback influences students’ self-assessments of computing ability and, in turn, students’ persistence in computing. Workshop content will be drawn from: 1) social-psychological research on self-assessments of ability and career choice, and 2) the results of a 3-year field experiment in an undergraduate computer science department at a R1 research university.  Negative feedback (particularly poor grades, which tend to be lower in computing than other university classes) makes it so that some students with enough ability to succeed in a computing career leave the field because they believe they have inadequate computing ability. Preliminary results from our field experiment suggest that giving CS0/CS1 students personalized feedback (via email from the professor) is effective at increasing students’ self-assessed computing ability, intentions to persist in computing, and the likelihood that women apply to be CS TAs.  Despite these benefits, giving personalized email feedback may seem too time-consuming for faculty to adopt. This workshop will help instructors give efficient and efficacious personalized feedback through: 1) empirically validated email templates, and 2) guidance on how to send personalized emails at-scale.  This workshop is intended for college/university instructors, especially those who teach introductory CS0/CS1 courses. Participants will need a laptop, Chrome Browser and a Google account. Workshop participants will come away knowing why email interventions work, how to design them effectively and send them with low effort, and a network of like-minded instructors in their community, who can support their efforts to improve students' self-assessments and persistence in computing.

    presenters: "Julia Bernd, International Computer Science Institute, USA; Dan Garcia, University of California, Berkeley, USA; Buffie Holley, Albemarle High School, USA; Maritza Johnson, University of San Diego, USA"
    ad: "This interactive workshop will introduce some of the foundational concepts of cybersecurity, including threat modeling, the importance of identity and authentication, and human factors in security. Through participating in model lessons, attendees will learn how to begin developing the \"security mindset\" in CS students. The workshop will provide an introduction for high school teachers new to cybersecurity (no previous experience required!), and an alternative approach for the more cyber-experienced. (No special equipment required either.) The Teaching Security materials available at teachingsecurity.org were prepared by subject-matter experts. They are designed to address some of the cybersecurity learning objectives in the AP Computer Science Principles framework, but are appropriate for any high school or community college computer science class or program (including dedicated cybersecurity classes). Why teach cybersecurity? Cybersecurity is a growing job field -- and even for students that don't pursue cybersecurity careers, it is crucial to have some level of security awareness to navigate our highly networked world! In addition, the real world implications of the topic lend themselves well to catching the interest of a diverse group of students in CS at a younger age. Laptop optional."

    ad: "Automated syntactic source code analysis is a useful technique for computing education researchers to examine what kind of code students are writing and for looking at patterns in the structure of the code.  It can be difficult to get started with this sort of analysis, however: it requires collection of sufficient source code data, and the analysis involves using custom parsers and processing syntax trees. mnbThis workshop will help computing education researchers to get started with source code analysis.  We will provide attendees with an opportunity to work with an existing data set of Java code -- Blackbox Mini -- using SrcML, an XML-based format for parsed code, and Python tools for processing and analysing this data.  At the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to start their own research studies of this type, allowing powerful analysis of program source code.   A very basic familiarity with Python and Java is assumed.  Please bring your own device, with WiFi and an SSH client (built-in to Mac and Linux, on Windows download PuTTY)."

    presenters: "Michael Goldweber, Xavier University, USA; Renzo Davoli, Università di Bologna, Italiy"
    ad: "An operating system is a software artifact. Like all software artifact-based courses (e.g. compilers, neural networks), the gold standard accompanying lab exercise is to build an instance of the artifact. uMPS3/Pandos is a new semester-long project, independent of text choice, for use in an operating systems course. The project guides students in writing, from scratch, a complete, though simple, operating system in C to run on an emulated MIPS-based system. This workshop will introduce participants to, uMPS3, the system emulator, the Pandos project –a detailed set of specifications/assignments that result in a completed operating system capable of concurrently executing up to eight student written C programs, and the wealth of supporting educational materials designed to aid both the instructor and their students. Though a Linux (Debian or Ubuntu) laptop (virtualization is fine) will allow for a hands-on experience with uMPS3/Pandos; one is not required for the workshop. Participants will learn how to use uMPS3, and will walk through each of the three core assignments and sample solutions. The workshop will culminate with the execution of participant written C program(s) running under a completed instance of Pandos. This workshop is designed to empower anyone who teaches an operating systems course to be successful in deploying uMPS3/Pandos in their operating system course. Preferred - laptop that either (dual) boots Linux, or is set up to run Linux via virtualization software."

    ad: "This workshop is designed to support participants in creating or improving teaching assistant (TA) programs at their university with an emphasis on how the program can positively impact broadening participation. Best practices for the organization, recruitment and training of TAs will be explored. During the workshop, participants will be given a “Literature Best Practices” worksheet that we have created to help them identify the key issues in designing a TA program with inclusiveness in mind. The best practices include all aspects of a TA program from recruitment to training including funding. Ideas from programs at small liberal arts institutions to those at large research institutions will be addressed. Participants will have opportunities to work in smaller groups to strategize what their individual programs need and explore our list of resources to solve their problems. In addition we will workshop some of the training materials we are using with our Teaching Assistants to encourage participants to adopt appropriate materials for their context.  Participants should bring a laptop to download electronic resources and to work on the Literature Practices Worksheet. When participants leave, they will have a framework they can use to discuss issues around diversity and inclusion in TA programs along with specific action items for their institution. In addition, they will have met others in the workshop that can support them as they return to implement positive change. It is encouraged to have multiple participants from the same university attend. The workshop is primarily oriented toward current faculty and department chairs at four year universities, with or without graduate students, but community college faculty and graduate students may also find the material useful and would be welcome.

    ad: "In response to the increasing need to address systemic inequities, departments are creating “BPC plans” to publicly declare how they are working to broaden participation in computing, as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion,  particularly for groups who have been marginalized or traditionally underrepresented in computing. A popular activity in these plans is to take a cohort of students to a diversity-focused computing conference, such as Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing (supporting people of color), the STARS Celebration of Diversity in Computing (promoting student and faculty BPC leadership and action), or the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. However, as faculty who have done this in the past, the experience is not always one that clearly benefits the CS department, beyond impacting each individual student attending the conference. The purpose of the STARS Ignite Workshop is to provide faculty and staff with a framework including the tools and knowledge needed to make such conference attendance beneficial both to the students attending the conference and to the sponsoring faculty and their department.  In this workshop, participants will learn to recruit and lead a BPC purpose-driven student conference cohort and the implementation of a BPC event or program. Participants will be provided with opportunities to adapt sample materials (recruitment emails, applications, etc.) to their own needs, assess the BPC needs at their institutions, and learn how to determine if their BPC efforts are successful. A laptop and Google account are required for this event. Interested attendees should be willing to commit to leading a student conference cohort to a diversity-oriented computing conference and then implementing a BPC event or program with these students.

    title: "Designing Autograders for Novice Programmers"
    presenters: "Chad Hogg, Millersville University, USA; Maria Jump, Northeastern University, USA"
    ad: "Students in introductory courses have under-developed debugging skills, intuition, and vocabulary, which makes it difficult for those students to understand logic errors in their code and to interpret messages designed to assist them in doing so. This is particularly true when instructors are relying on automated grading frameworks to providing students with instantaneous feedback. This Designing Autograders for Novice Programmers workshop will present and discuss strategies for using industry-standard testing frameworks to design automatic tests, or autograders, that are particularly targeted to the novice student.  Novice students make a much wider variety of mistakes than students in upper-division courses, including many that would cause simple autograders to fail spectacularly (i.e. submitting the wrong file). For these reasons, a poorly-designed autograder may be less useful to novice students than none at all. However, we will present strategies for thoughtfully designing your autograder that will anticipate a wide variety of possible failure modes, explore deeply to discover their root causes, and explain the failures in a way that is comprehensible. We will demonstrate how we have done this using existing grading frameworks (i.e., Autogradr, Gradescope) using static analysis, unit tests, and other techniques. Both instructors who have never written autograders before and those who have but have been dissatisfied with the quality of feedback that they produce will benefit from the workshop.  One of the presenters primarily works with undergraduates and the other with graduate students (who are novice programmers), but the same techniques should also be applicable in secondary education.  Following discussion of design strategies and examples, attendees will work to build an autograder for a simple programming assignment and test submitting to an autograder built by another attendee.  Access to a computing device that can edit text documents and upload them through a web interface will be required.  Persons attending the workshop virtually should expect to have a similar experience to those attending physically."

    ad: "Come learn about the 30 free and interactive ebooks on the open-source Runestone Interactive platform that can be used in high school (AP CSP and AP CSA) or college computing courses (CS1, CS2, data science, and web programming).  These ebooks include executable and modifiable code (Python, Java, C++, SQL, etc) and a wide variety of practice problems. One of the types of practice problems, mixed-up code (Parsons) problems, will adapt their difficulty based on the learner's performance. Learn about exciting new features including support for Peer Instruction, choice questions, and exam generation.  In Peer Instruction an instructor displays a hard multiple-choice question, students answer individually, then discuss with a peer (in-person or via chat), and then answer again.  Peer Instruction has been shown to improve student engagement and learning.  Choice questions can be used to give students a choice of which question to answer for credit.  They have been used to allow students to choose to write the equivalent code rather than solve a mixed-up code (Parsons) problem.  Exam questions can be automatically generated from a set of questions or from topics.   Also learn how to create a custom course, enroll students in a custom course, create assignments, grade assignments, view student progress, and optionally require use of a spaced practice tool.  Students enjoy using the ebooks.  They appreciate the immediate feedback and the variety of practice problems. Attendees must bring a laptop.

From finite-state machines to time as a functional requirement, the workshop (and associated semester-long course) introduces connections between formal theory and real-world practice and will get your students started down the path from amateur hobbyist to professional designer. A laptop with USB access is required, and all participants will be able to take home a copy of the hardware used during the workshop."

    title: "Integrating Parallel and Distributed Computing in Early CS Courses"
    presenters: "Sheikh Ghafoor, Tennessee Tech University, USA; Sushil Prasad, University of Texas San Antonio, USA; Charles Weems, University of Massachusetts Amherst , USA"
    ad: "All computing devices that students use currently have multiple cores as well as GPU in many cases. Most of their favorite applications use multiple cores and numbers of distributed processors. However, we are still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking. Why?  This hands-on workshop will demonstrate how easy it is to open their eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving, starting in their earliest courses. You'll be participating in unplugged activities that will help students to recognize examples of Parallel Distributed Computing concepts and concurrency in the world around them. Participants will learn how freely available libraries can be used to naturally exploit parallelism, though both plugged and unplugged activities. No equipment or experience is necessary for the activities though a laptop that can run C++, Java, and python is recommended for following along with some code examples.  Active learning plugged and unplugged modules that have been used successfully to teach PDC concept in early CS courses will be shared. The target audience for this workshop are faculty who teaches in undergraduate computing programs, especially early computing courses, and do not have parallel and distributed computing expertise. Participants will receive a stipend of $300 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. Laptop required."
