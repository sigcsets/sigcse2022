    title: "Google Supporter Session &mdash; Technical Writing for All Students"
    day: "3/2/2022"
    start: "8:30"
    end: "12:00"
    location: "Room 554 A/B (RICC)"

    presenters: "Barry Rosenberg (Google), Tina Ornduff (Google)"
    description: "Most engineering students don't realize that professional engineers spend much of their day writing. Communicating clearly and efficiently is often the key difference between a mediocre engineering career and a great engineering career. In 2015, Google created technical writing courses specifically aimed at software engineers. To everyone's surprise, these courses became popular. In fact, more than half of all Google software engineers have now taken at least part of a technical writing course. In 2020, Google released free versions of these courses externally. During this session, Barry Rosenberg and Tina Ornduff--two of the courses' creators--will describe the available resources and answer your questions about teaching technical writing principles to CS students."

    description: "It has been a long standing tradition for employers to complain that CS graduates lack many Day-1 job-readiness skills and for faculty to insist that academic programs should focus on long-lasting foundational material instead of trying to satisfy the multitude of short-term employer needs. If a CS undergraduate program was designed by employers of CS graduates, it would look considerably different from today’s academia-designed programs, as shown in the parallel education computing programs now being offered by several employers. This session asks several questions relevant to CS curricula: Is there a middle ground? Is there a principled approach to addressing the balance? How does one balance foundational concepts with practical skills? How would we know what is effective and what is not? Come join the discussion and participate in a workshop that will not only feature industry panelists but also a hands-on design component.

    description: "Microsoft’s ElectionGuard is a free, open-source toolkit that is being used by election equipment vendors to produce “end-to-end verifiable” elections.  In these elections, voters can confirm on their own that their votes are correctly counted – without having to trust election officials, equipment vendors, or anyone else.  Any and all tampering with votes and tallies – even insider tampering – becomes detectable by candidates, parties, news media, and even individual voters.  Independent election verification apps can be written to check the accuracy and consistency of publishes election records. This tutorial will describe how ElectionGuard works and how student projects can be fashioned to write independent ElectionGuard verifiers or work with the code in other ways."

The analysis can also help cheating in your class, with specific techniques suggested to reduce it (and measured to see impact).

We will share educator implementation strategies for using Revel to teach online with Python, Java and C++ in distance, hybrid, and in-person orientations. You will also hear about Pearson's Efficacy Report on using Revel to teach introductory programming concepts and how it determined additional success metrics for students who engaged in active learning and coding practices. See firsthand how students can start to code in the early stages of the course and receive immediate feedback if their submissions were correct or need further refinement."

    * Student work and progress update on all pages in real-time.
    * Embeddable, collaborative, online coding environments supporting the most popular languages. No downloads or setup required! Students can access from any device connected to the internet.
    * An intuitive and seamless authoring tool with interactive assessments (multiple-choice, short answer, fill in the blank, parsons problems, code select, and more).
    * Assessment autograding including for coding exercises using input/output comparisons and the most popular unit testing frameworks.
    * Use the code playback feature to check for plagiarism and monitor student effort. First-class support for synchronous and asynchronous teaching and learning.
    * Free curriculum content you can add to, modify, and delete from to build your own custom course.
    Come learn about the best platform for connecting with each student, seeing their work, and engage with their code instantly."

    description: "To accommodate the growing need for Data Science, Eastern University launched their online Master’s Program in Data Science in August of 2020. After seeing substantial growth in student numbers, their traditional (manual) methods of grading and assessment in D2L Brightspace did not fit anymore. Together with CodeGrade, they have automated most of their courses and in this session Dr. Greg Longo, Program Director at Eastern, and Youri Voet, CEO at CodeGrade, will walk you through the considerations, feedback and future plans for automatic and manual assessment of Data Science and Programming Education. Dr. Greg Longo is Associate Professor of Data Science and Program Director of the Master’s in Data Science at Eastern University. He received his PhD from Virginia Tech. Youri Voet is co-founder and CEO at CodeGrade and former teaching assistant at the University of Amsterdam."
