        "The Peer Teaching Summit 2022 will bring together Computer Science (CS) faculty and peer teaching leaders who are seeking resources, tools, and strategies for training and supporting peer teachers (also referred to as undergraduate teaching assistants, tutors, etc.) for large enrollment CS classes. Undergraduates can be employed in support of a department's teaching mission to improve student engagement, learning, and retention - particularly among students from groups underrepresented in CS.
        <br><br>
        Summit participants will discuss how their program supports and trains undergraduates as teaching assistants, section leaders, lab assistants, mentors, and tutors. How do peer teachers most effectively help students to problem-solve? To debug? To create an inclusive culture in computing? To gain confidence? In describing their programs, participants will share best practices, lessons learned, and relevant research. This summit will connect faculty and peer teaching leaders who are interested in brainstorming and sharing tools and strategies for peer teaching programs.

        "A successful career as an educator involves more than a deep understanding of a research area. Even so, many new CS educators experience relatively little training as educators – and face more questions than answers, e.g., How do I find a career path and institution that are right for me? What strategies can I use during the job search and interviewing process to achieve my goals? What tips could help me organize a course, scaffold engaging experiences, and build lasting relationships with students? What practical steps can I take to support equity, diversity, and inclusion in my work?
        <br><br>
        The Professional Development Session for New and Aspiring Educators is a pre-symposium event at SIGCSE 2022 that, through presentations, discussions, and small-group community building, will tackle these questions. The session is designed to assist aspiring and early-career educators in exploring the non-research facets of an academic career. It will run on March 2, 2022 in Providence, Rhode Island, USA from 9am to 5pm, and is open to postdocs and graduate students in any year who are considering careers in academia, as well as pre-tenure faculty members and new teaching-track faculty seeking guidance and/or networking support. This session is one of several career-focused, SIGCSE-affiliated events at the 2022 Technical Symposium that have served more than 200 educators over the past decade.

Communicating clearly and efficiently is often the key difference between a mediocre engineering career and a great engineering career. In 2015, Google created technical writing courses specifically aimed at software engineers. To everyone's surprise, these courses became popular. In fact, more than half of all Google software engineers have now taken at least part of a technical writing course. In 2020, Google released free versions of these courses externally. During this session, Barry Rosenberg and Tina Ornduff--two of the courses' creators--will describe the available resources and answer your questions about teaching technical writing principles to CS students."

This full day event will be split into two sessions. The first session will focus on innovations in computing education in the liberal arts and may include courses, curricula, co-curricular programs or other elements that reflect a specifically liberal arts perspective. Selected submissions will be presented and discussed at the event and also be added to the Committee’s growing repository of materials. The second session will be held in an “unconference” format, with proposals accepted for working group topics from the community as a whole. Possible topics include but are not limited to course design and assessment for CS+X courses, strategies for recruiting faculty to teach at liberal arts colleges, and course- specific topics such as implementing specifications grading or implementing inclusive teaching practices. Throughout the event, sessions will give participants an opportunity to learn about work already taking place within the liberal arts computing community as well as to engage in Q&A and breakout discussions. All interested faculty and students are welcome.

        "Enrollment in CS courses and programs continues to be high. To meet this increased demand, many Ph.D. granting departments have added or are actively recruiting teaching faculty (typically with academic rank) to their faculty. This whole-day event will focus on the professional development of teaching-track faculty (professor of practice, instructor, clinical faculty, lecturer, etc.) in Ph.D. granting departments. The event fills a crucial need as many departments have limited experience on how to mentor, evaluate, and promote this new type of faculty. The sessions will focus on how teaching faculty can strategize their involvement in departmental as well as research activities, different forms of scholarship and leadership activities to pursue, and best practices for success, promotion, and advancement. Junior and mid-career teaching-track faculty will participate in an “unconference” format. By gathering topics of common interest, attendees will self organize to provide peer mentoring and to collect advice for professional development rather than having pre-planned panels or sessions at the discretion of the organizers.

        "Computing for the Social Good in Education (CSG-Ed) deals with methods for producing computing graduates who are focused on using their computing education towards the benefit of society. We invite participants to discuss how they would reimagine their insti- tution’s and general computing curriculum, if they were supreme, magic wand wielding, curricular overlords.
        <br><br>
        Currently, computing is perceived as a practical means to ensure a livelihood, but often overlooked as a path for empowering the disadvantaged and raising the quality of life for all. Furthermore, the numerous headlines exemplifying computing by the elite and for the elite at the expense of everyone else, or, stated differently, examples of technology companies shirking any responsibility to remedy the unintended harmful consequences of their products, pushes a view of computing that is a self-serving one. The view being that those making the technology get rich doing it, leave everyone else behind and do not care about those left behind or harmed by their products. This prevailing, and somewhat bleak, perception of computing’s impact on society is not the whole picture. Yet, such a climate can impact students’ choice of major, how they view their own field and the choices they make as a professional after they graduate. How are our computing curricula perpetuating the current perceptions of computing, acquiescing to this perception or working to expand the view of what computing can do for society? Are we combating the false dichotomy and showing students that they can have a successful career without exploiting anyone and do so while using their computing skills to benefit society?
        <br><br>
        We give you a magic wand; what does your new computing curriculum look like?
        <br><br>
        This free and open to all, [SIGCAS-sponsored affiliated event](https://www.sigcas.org/csged/) will explore this question through prepared presentations, group activities, and the sharing of pro- posals among the participants and hopefully the larger computing education community. Our shared intent is to shape the next gen- eration of computing curricula, such as the upcoming [Computer Science Curricula 202X report](https://csed.hosting.acm.org/)"

        "In this session, participants will learn from faculty about how they have integrated accessibility and disability topics into their computer science courses. There are certain courses, such as web or app design and development and human-computer interactions, that should be addressing accessibility because of the human-facing nature of software. Less obvious are courses, such as intro CS, computer vision, natural language processing, data compression, software engineering, and others, that can also have accessibility and disability content. After the presentations, participants will break into small groups to discuss more ways to include these topics into their courses. The contents of the workshop will be documented and be available on the AccessComputing website after the conference.

    description: "It has been a long standing tradition for employers to complain that CS graduates lack many Day-1 job-readiness skills and for faculty to insist that academic programs should focus on long-lasting foundational material instead of trying to satisfy the multitude of short-term employer needs. If a CS undergraduate program was designed by employers of CS graduates, it would look considerably different from today’s academia-designed programs, as shown in the parallel education computing programs now being offered by several employers. This session asks several questions relevant to CS curricula: Is there a middle ground? Is there a principled approach to addressing the balance? How does one balance foundational concepts with practical skills? How would we know what is effective and what is not? Come join the discussion and participate in a workshop that will not only feature industry panelists but also a hands-on design component.

      **Reflections on Programming Methodology**
      <br>
      Research in programming methodology led to the development of the principles and methods that underlie how modern software systems are designed and structured.  At the center of this work are the notions of abstraction and modularity. These ideas are related: design is the process of inventing and identifying abstractions, and the implementations of the abstractions become the modules that make up the program.  This talk will discuss our current understanding of abstraction and modularity and the research that got us to where we are today.

      **Improving Diversity in Computing through Increased Access and Success**
      <br>
      My goal is to increase diversity in computing. In this talk I explain why diversity is important to me.  My strategy to improve diversity is to increase access and success.  This work includes teacher professional development, summer camps, weekend workshops with youth serving organizations, curriculum development, helping states make systemic changes to computing education, publicizing gender and race issues in Advanced Placement Computer Science, creating free and interactive ebooks, testing new types of practice problems/tools, and offering near-peer mentoring programs.
      <br><br>
      **Barbara Ericson** is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan.  She conducts research at the intersection of computing education, the learning sciences and HCI, to improve students' access to and success in computing. With her husband and colleague, Dr. Mark Guzdial, she received the 2010 ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for their work on media computation.  She was the 2012 winner of the A. Richard Newton Educator Award for her efforts to attract more females to computing.  She is also an ACM Distinguished Member for Outstanding Educational Contributions to Computing."

Over the last two years, Google's Technical Higher Education Team has worked to create two different types of educational experiences in the hopes of being able to provide opportunities that can scale to many learners while remaining flexible in the face of screen fatigue and other challenges that students face. In this session we will explore these two models: a hybrid program called Problem of the Week, and our fully remote program, Bridge. The team will share our findings and what future steps Google plans to take for both online and in-person learning going forward with these programs."

      **Diversifying Computing: Real Change Must Come from Within**
      <br>
      In addition to holding the key to solving some of our most pressing challenges, it is no secret that computing touches nearly every facet of modern life. As a result, society can no longer afford for these fields to be reserved for a chosen few. It is imperative that we are inclusive of a broad range of student identities, so they can contribute to the driving the future of technologies that will impact the world as well as participate in economic opportunities presented by tech innovation. Changing this trajectory cannot rely on those most marginalized in computing. Rather, institutions must actively analyze and change the policies and practices that serve as barriers to diversifying the landscape. In this talk, Dr. Daily will discuss the challenges associated with centering interventions on marginalized groups as well as how we can move towards a more inclusive future of computing by focusing within.
      <br><br>
      **Shaundra Daily** is professor of the practice of electrical and computer engineering & computer science at Duke University. Prior to joining Duke, she was an associate professor with tenure at the University of Florida in the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering.
      <br><br>
      Dr. Daily's research focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of technologies, programs, and curricula to support diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM fields. Her approach has focused on three key strategies: designing, implementing, and evaluating technologies that enhance interpersonal skills that will facilitate collaboration in diverse settings; creating technologies and programs geared towards making computing and engineering accessible to diverse audiences; and mentoring, participating in outreach, and researching the experiences of marginalized groups in computing and engineering.
      <br><br>
      Having garnered over $40M in funding from public and private sources to support her research activities, Daily’s work has been featured in USA Today, Forbes, National Public Radio, and the Chicago Tribune. Daily earned her B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University – Florida State University College of Engineering, and a S.M. and Ph.D. from the MIT Media Lab."
