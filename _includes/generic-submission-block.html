## How Do I Submit My {{ include.submissiontype }}?

SIGCSE {{site.year}} is **not participating in the new ACM workflow**, template, and production system.  *MS Word Authors*, please use the Interim Template. *LaTeX Authors*, please use the official ACM Master with the   `ACM_SigConf` template.

{% if submissiontype == 'Paper' %}

Write your paper using the format specified above. Within the anonymized paper, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors, General Terms, and Keywords based on the ACM classification system. These requirements are described in more detail in the [ACM Computing Classification System]({{site.data.publishing.acmclassifications}}).

Recall that you will also need to cut-and-paste or type your text abstract description into a text box during the submission process.

Be sure to choose the appropriate topic areas when submitting. Your choices help in assigning appropriate reviewers to your submission, and assist the reviewers in evaluating the paper from an appropriate perspective.

{% elsif submissiontype == 'Panel' or submissiontype == 'Special Session' %}

Write your submission using the format specified above. Within the proposal, you must provide Category and Subject Descriptors, General Terms, and Keywords, just as paper authors must do. These requirements are described in more detail in the [ACM Computing Classification System]({{site.data.publishing.acmclassifications}}).

{% else %}

Write your submission using the format specified above.

{% if site.data.cfp.submissionopen %}

{% callout info %}
Please limit the number of topic choices to no more than 5.  This will help match your submission with reviewers.

Convert your submission-ready paper into Adobe PDF format. Refer to our [Creating Adobe PDF Documents page](creating_pdf.html) page for assistance.

A PDF version of your submission should be uploaded using [the online submission system - EasyChair]({{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}).  

Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!

Make note of the proposal ID number and password assigned to your submission. You will receive an email message confirmation. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you may need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance or rejection notification.

After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy. Send email to the chair(s) (see below) if there are any problems.
