## How Do I Submit My {{ include.submissiontype }}?

{% include alert danger='Please be aware that the submission form asks you to provide demographic information. This demographic information is being collected by ACM; they created the questions and require them to be in the submission form.

{% elsif submissiontype == 'Panel' or submissiontype == 'Special Session' %}

{% else %}

 - Recall that you will also need to copy-and-paste or type your text abstract description into a text box in the submission form. Be sure that the same text appears in the submission and in the abstract text box in the submission form.

 - Be sure to choose the appropriate topic areas when submitting. Your choices help in assigning appropriate reviewers to your submission, and assist the reviewers in evaluating the paper from an appropriate perspective.

 - **When you're ready to submit**, 
   use [the online submission system - EasyChair]({{site.data.cfp.submissionurl}}) to complete the submission form and upload your submission. In addition to uploading the PDF version of your submission, you will fill out a form with metadata about your submission.

Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your documents because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server!

Make note of the proposal ID number and password assigned to your submission. You will receive an email message confirmation. Spam filters sometimes trap these automatically generated messages so you may need to check your spam trap for the confirmation and later, acceptance or rejection notification.

After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to **review your submission for accuracy**. Send email to the chair(s) (see below) if there are any problems.
